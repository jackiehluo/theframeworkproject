Suite, and she's worked at companies like Pinterest, Andreessen Horowitz, and Code2040.</h3><h3 dir=\"ltr\">She invited me to a coffee shop in Oakland, where we discussed everything from selective accountability in the tech industry to the social implications of misinformation to the importance of humanistic perspectives in building technologies.</h3>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>So you were recently talking about the news about Theranos because Elizabeth Holmes was charged with fraud, and it's just been an escalating scandal in the past year or two. And you raised a lot of points about accountability and oversight and how that gets applied selectively. I was curious where you think existing systems are failing us and how you think the cycle could change.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>Okay. Let's see, where do I think these existing systems are failing us? I think, by default, there are a lot of groups in society and communities that people have been taught to give the benefit of the doubt, and then there are groups that people are taught to be hyper-vigilant around.</p><p>So, case in point, you think about, when you walk on the street, you're never taught—not taught consciously—\"Oh, hold your bag close to you when you see a black person coming.\" Right? It's not a learned behavior that you have for white people. If I told you, \"Oh, have you ever pulled your bag closer when a white guy is walking next to you?\" That would be—right?—like, \"Huh?\" You know?</p><p>I think that's where the system's failing us—that we only show certain groups as being irresponsible, \"violent,\" when, in actuality, everyone is capable of mistakes. Everyone is capable of missteps. So I think that is a space that's failing us, and we just need to humanize everybody. Remind people that white women make mistakes, white women can be in the wrong, you know, black folks make mistakes, black people can be in the wrong, and we can be in the right, too. Thinking about who gets the benefit of the doubt. Reminding people that everyone is capable of evil, everyone is capable of harming others, and that there shouldn't just be a spotlight on these particular groups.</p><p>I think, in the bigger picture, we just need to remind folks that—I think a lot of times narratives have placed a lot of white communities as saviors, right? Saviors as in, \"Here is the pinnacle of moral of moral guidance.\" So think about it when you see organizations like Save the Children. You never really see black folks going to an impoverished white countries, you know, ever. Ever. So then you have people who are constantly seeing that in the media thinking, \"If I am of this race, I'm inherently perfect and great and not flawed.\"</p><p>Then we have to reconcile that with a situation like Theranos. You're in constant denial because those are not the narratives that you see, and I think, as humans, it's hard for us to grasp. Like, wait, hold on, you're operating out of the pattern and the narrative that I've established. So then you're going to keep on letting things pass. Even when you think something could be off. You keep on giving the benefit of the doubt. Hopefully that answers your question?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, for sure. It's really hard because so much of it is just, you know, literally how people's brains work to process information. Another thing that I thought was interesting about Theranos in particular was how media narratives build on each other. Like, there's one glowing piece, and then, subsequently after that, everyone is trying to work off this narrative that's ultimately pretty arbitrary. Is there anything you've been thinking about in terms of that? Ways to disrupt what I see as media cycles that can unnecessarily amplify certain aspects of the story?</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>I think it goes back to—okay, all these terms. I think it's a money thing, right? Like, that is the beast that we've created, right, that you can have a really great quality story, but that's not getting you clicks. That's not getting you views. And in this day and age it's just, like, \"Hey, if I need to get a trending piece to get me into the conversation, so be it.\" Because especially in this just-in-time, everything needs to be now, now, now, really distracted generation—there's so much information out there.</p><p>So I think we've created this beast. These things aren't super well-funded. So they can't operate—well, they can operate from a place of power, but you have to have lots of capital to not need to be in this cycle. And people want to be shareable. In this social world, people want people to look at their content and if that means, wait, hold on, someone else had the foundation [of the story], but, wait, I found one little line more that shows that we know more. It's just, like, \"No, look at me. Look at me!\" The first person introduces the story, then everyone else is like, \"Look at me, look at me, no, come here! I have a little more.\"</p><p>You're just playing these games versus saying, \"No, these stories are substantial stories that I think are important.\" But I also think it goes to this obsession with the numbers game that I think society and culture has played, in that numbers—we talk about how much we want quality, but we don't act like it. You know what I mean? As much as we say about quality, quality content.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>We talk about how much we want quality, but we don’t act like it.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>I think about how people design systems for popularity. I think about Instagram. Instagram won't give certain people access to swipe up to learn more. So, basically, certain things are reserved for influencers, but then it's just like, okay. Well, I might be a person with less than a thousand followers, but I still have quality content that might deem that—it's just that we design systems in which we incentivize popularity, influence, virality, versus quality. So it's also a design play, too, and not like, \"How do we redesign business operations? How do we thoughtfully think about numbers and that they aren't just the one metric around quality and success?\"</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Oh, yeah, I think it's super relevant. Did you see Ev Williams <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ev/the-rationalization-of-publishing-dc001d509de8\">published</a>—</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>It's on my docket! It's on my to-do list.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Oh, well, I think the TL;DR is just that Medium tried an ad-supported model. Now they're doing subscription. Unclear how well it's going, but his whole post was focused around the idea that it isn't sustainable for all media to be ad-supported, and I think all of this drama with Facebook and everything builds on that. I think a lot of that is just lies in the popularity, virality, whatever, aspect of it. Do you see subscription media as a realistic option, you know, something that can be commonplace?</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>So it's a nuanced answer because I think, on one end, I keep on going back to it—we've created this beast. While [subscription media]&nbsp;could be [commonplace], people don't even know what quality is anymore. You know what I mean? Nowadays, people's relationships to information have drastically changed. Like, back in the day, you would go to a few news sites, and you could get all your information. Now everyone thinks they're a journalist. We've lost the art. We've lost the art of having people literally trained to tell you stories.</p><p>So to the average person, from a business standpoint, why am I going to pay you, a company, to give me \"quality\" journalism when I think I can get quality journalism from my friend over here who was at the scene of an event and live-tweeted it? I think there is an opportunity for subscriptions to be a thing, but we have to remind people what quality journalism is, in a way that's not so elitist.</p><p>I think the way that people act and think about it from a business intelligence perspective—all the quality media outlets were always so expensive. We've designed a really elitist—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, people always talk about <em>The Information</em>, for instance.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>Yeah, you've designed a really elitist kind of system. So, in my opinion, we have to reframe people's relationships to information—high-quality information—that it can be accessible, not cost, like, hundreds of dollars, because who can afford that?</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>We have to reframe people’s relationships to information—high-quality information—that it can be accessible, not cost, like, hundreds of dollars, because who can afford that?<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>That's a great point. There's always an intellectualism associated with it, which I don't think has to be the case.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>So then some person is like, \"Well, why do I need to pay this subscription if, you know, I don't feel like I'm aligned with that?\" I hate to say it, but information needs a rebranding.&nbsp;I think that's reminding people that, the same way you pay for insurance, the same way you pay for a lot of things that don't seem to be super important but are really beneficial.</p><p>We can change people's relationship to information and just remind them. As we get older—when you were younger, you had your textbooks and whatever. But [media]&nbsp;is our diet these days. Literally every day, day in and day out, we're processing information. It's going to have positive or negative effects on your anxiety, on your health, on your mental health. The content that you're consuming is now the main form of how we engage.</p><p>I guess I'm trying to say is, subscriptions do have an opportunity to have a renaissance, but we really need to have a rehashing of how we position information, how we position quality content, how we can position journalists. This idea that everyone's on Twitter and everyone's a journalist. Yes, it augments it, but we shouldn't just rely on that as a source of full nutrition and full insight. These folks aren't trained necessarily to—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, on Twitter, there's such a thin line, where you'll have a random person demanding from an expert, \"Why should I believe what you're saying?\"</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>We don't teach people this due diligence as well. Even going back to how our systems are designed—verified checks are given to pretty much everyone, right? So I think maybe going back to certain badges—this person is knowledgeable, an expert. Twitter has that information when they look at your analytics. With whom do you resonate the most? Even having key terms—this person talks a lot about <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, or <em>z</em>, to say that they might have some insight and understanding—and you shouldn't assume they don't know what they're talking about.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, it's weird to have everyone appear to be on equal footing, even if they aren't when it comes to the information they have, but, you know, you don't see that on Twitter, right?</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>And then—here's the trust and safety in me—we've also messed up that because then it's like, I don't want all my information out there. Nowadays, people are not trying to hear you. So then even if I were like, \"Yeah, here are all the places, all the credentials that I have,\" someone would be like, \"Oh, what do you mean? I don't care about that.\" Then, well, I don't want to have all that information on there because you never know how people might—call your boss or manager, you know. It's the balance around that.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, for sure. Okay, so on an unrelated note, then, I think you referenced it, but I'm not sure if you have a more general take on it—about misinformation and how to deal with having content at scale.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>Yes, I think I did. It's crazy, right? My little solution would be treating it like counterfeit bills. At every office, with counterfeit bills, you literally have trainings on it. You learn to spot it. People build technologies to check for counterfeit bills. People even thought about, like, \"How do we not even use bills?\" Right? We don't have to deal with that.</p><p>So I think people think this problem is just a Facebook issue, but no, no, no, people's lives are at stake. Working in trust and safety roles, I would see certain [fabricated] photos that people made, and I'd be like, \"Are they allowed?\" The thing about it is, there's a lot of virality. Information spreads quickly nowadays. I call it the weapon. The weapon of misinformation. I feel like that's the next book title or something.</p><p>It's more and more lethal these days. I think about the death by a thousand cuts—it seems like it's minute and tiny, but at scale it's really scary. It has real-life implications. You're playing with people's emotions here. You're playing to people's emotions that can invoke rage, fear, distrust. With misinformation, particularly with images—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Images and video, too, have historically been mediums that people have been able to trust. Fakes were, you know, easy to tell, and it's becoming less and less easy.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>Voice is what really scares me. Voice is what really scares me in that way. Which goes to my frustration with technology sometimes. Hey, cool new tech! We're not going to think about implications. Throw it out there into the world. I'm just like, \"Does anyone do an audit?\"</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>I interviewed—I don't want to cast them to the wind or whatever—but I talked to this company when I was looking for a new job. Andreessen Horowitz has this talent network and introduced me to one of their portfolio companies. I didn't know what they did until I was talking to them, and it was AI-based voice imitation technology. It was so interesting. I was like, \"Oh, what kind of ethical measures have you taken to make sure that people don't have their voices falsified without their knowledge?\" A few questions along those lines. And it's really unfortunate. It was clearly an afterthought. There's just so much more energy in the industry as a whole going towards making these technologies as opposed to building tools that also counteract them.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>I love innovation. I'm excited about innovation, right? But at the same time, I think we need to step back and understand the implications of, for instance, someone who doesn't like me getting the ability to doctor my voice. My voice information is easily accessible, you know. It's gonna be more easily accessible with the rise in podcasts, the rise in videos. Someone can pull that information and frame me for something.</p><p>And then I think a lot about systems. You're going to have tech that can be exploited in systems that aren't just. So then what if I get framed for something? I get thrown into a system that isn't really optimized for me. That's not going to listen to me.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. I think our legal system is just not prepared at all. Today, in a court of law, a lot of evidence—photos, videos, audio, whatever—holds up, and I don't know if they have good alternatives, really.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>So I think about the best possible scenario and the worst. If someone goes out and kills someone because of a picture that they saw that showed someone getting attacked, who's at fault? If they felt like they were in danger—that is a term that's commonly thrown out. If someone sees a doctored picture of someone harming a family member of theirs, and then they go out there and commit an act based on that, are they in the wrong? That is what they saw. There are implications around that.</p><p>I feel like we need a way to see that this image was altered. Having a seal or a watermark or a site that shows a picture's history. The history of the sound. What was the source?</p><p>With companies, it's weird because I don't want one company having all our data, but I think companies need to think about how they work together to fight this problem. I hate to get serious, but when people are dealing with child pornography, there's this concept called hashing. Like, yeah, there's this central space that can pick up this content if it's on another site to mitigate people having to look at that kind of content.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>To relieve the load from the content moderators.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>As well as just having a space where this content has been vetted as a piece of content that is particularly harmful. Thinking along the lines of a similar kind of mindset or view. What is a hash-like technology that can map out and say the history of this piece of content, the history of this voice data? I think we've really got to get serious about it because I see people's lives at stake in this issue. Right now we're all pretty on edge. People are emotional, and people aren't really processing the things that they see. We're reactionary.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>So that was a long-winded answer.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It's just so relevant, and it's something that I feel like a lot of people have really been worried about personally. Not just in the context of their own lives, but really internalizing current events and how this tech complicates it so much. I was listening to—have you heard of <em>Reply All</em>, the podcast?</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>I feel like I've heard of it.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>For the first time yesterday, I listened to an episode, and there was one <a href=\"https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/110-antifa-supersoldier-spectacular\">episode</a> about the antifa supersoldiers meme. Where a bunch of alt-right people misunderstood a troll and thought that a civil war was going to start and went out in the streets on the day of the civil war was supposed to start, and all these liberals were like, \"LOL, yeah, I'm coming to join you at the civil war in my mechsuit or whatever.\" But people believed that. It's totally real for a lot of people that, like, this civil war was a possibility, and they stopped it by going out there, which is wild.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>This tech supports the view that I have that folks who are creating it don’t understand people—they don’t understand culture. You’re dealing with people’s safety.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>But then it goes to—what people don't understand is—voice,&nbsp;that's literally the OG means of communication, right? That's how we communicate our warnings or opportunities of attack. This tech supports the view that I have that folks who are creating it don't understand people—they don't understand culture. You're dealing with people's safety. Safety will push you to do some crazy things. Biologically, you have a fight-or-flight instinct, in that our body hates to be scared. So you have these alert systems.</p><p>I think it's going to be really impactful for us to be serious because people don't play around with safety. People make rash decisions when they feel like their safety is threatened, when they feel like their credibility is threatened, when they feel like—anything that's related to self. Our bodies naturally will get into a panic mode. And I think we have to remind ourselves of that. Those responses are the feelings that misinformation evokes.</p><p>For me, I think about a better survey Facebook could have done is, instead of just asking if misinformation is bad, starting to map out how people felt when they saw a piece of misinformation.&nbsp;What did it evoke for you? If it is a piece of misinformation, someone's doing research on it. Right? Then starting to map out the bigger implications. If all these things are making people feel angry, sad, frustrated, ready to attack—that's not safe. Those feelings are not good constant states.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It's such a hard balance to have. I don't necessarily want Facebook and Twitter actively controlling like people's emotions, but also at some point they're amplifying certain ones more than others in the existing state. So I don't know.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>I don't think I would want Facebook to do it. But I do think some researcher needs step back and do the mappings of those implications around misinformation because people don't want to believe it's a problem until something bad happens. Even when something bad happens, people still don't want to believe things are problems, but that's neither here nor there.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Okay, so another question I had was around venture capital and its faults. I think there are a lot of things wrong with the current model of venture capital, but, in general, do you see that model changing and becoming less focused on big firms and more focused on smaller individual investors? Do you think that's a good solution to that?</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>I do think that venture needs to step up with the times and understand the power and impact that it has. I think venture can be such a force for good, but it also can be such a force for inequality. Certain companies would not be seen in the light of day if they didn't have venture dollars, in the sense that their ability to scale and grow has been extremely expedited. So, when on top of that, you're placing just a lot of bias and a lot of false positives, that can lead to a really unequal playing field.</p><p>I think VC needs to step back and understand the power that it has and the message that it sends, too, in that it creates this codependency. Like, if you don't have venture dollars—think about all the articles that we see. So-and-so just raised something, so-and-so just got to profitability. So-and-so just had a revenue rate—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, it's like an imaginary series of trophies.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>I think venture needs to just have a wake-up call in its role in impacting innovation versus influencing inequity. It just wasn't ready for the impact that technology would have, in my opinion, so now they're like, \"Okay, so we have all this power, we're able to influence all these things. What does a healthy model look like?\"</p><p>I do appreciate the different funds popping up, but what I do think—I hate to say it—these folks have years and years of relationships. These older firms have seen more, right? I do wonder, then, when we're creating these smaller funds... are we setting those folks up for success or failure?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. Well, I mean, firms like Sequoia funded, like, Google.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>They're working with a different kind of metric. Because they've been in the game longer, their rates of success look different. I worry with smaller funds that you're still going to be risk-averse because you want to have good points on the board. The very thing we're trying to avoid—VC as particularly focused and biased—it's like, \"Are you able to take those risks?\" Because you're also trying to prove yourself. Because you still have to get returns. You're still playing by the big boys' game, even if you're not.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>With VC, for me, I would love for people to see that the role that they’re playing in true innovation and then the role that they’re playing in inequity. Are we truly setting up a system that enables more people to win, more people to create, opportunities of wealth creation for their communities?<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>With VC, for me, I would love for people to see that the role that they're playing in true innovation and then the role that they're playing in inequity. Are we truly setting up a system that enables more people to win, more people to create, opportunities of wealth creation for their communities? VC is having this awakening. Like, yes, you guys are smart, yes, there's thoughtfulness and methodologies. But there also is a lot of luck.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Randomness.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>And randomness. And network impact. Yeah, of course you're going to be able to invest in this company because you're friends and, you know, went to school together or this person trusts you to share the idea in the early stages. I think VC is just going through a humbling phase.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>That was super interesting. Yeah, I think about that in particular—the question of who's set up for success. I think it's also easy to typecast VC firms with diverse partners as, \"Oh, they're just the diversity firms,\" even when some of them are explicitly not trying to do that. Let's see. For the next question, around time management and what's considered valuable time spent in the tech industry—there's this strong cultural emphasis on intellectualism and production, I think, as you put it, which feels really accurate to me. Like, everyone needs to be reading the latest Ray Dalio book. There's a lot of posturing around it. How do you think about that personally? What does that say industry-wide?</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>You know, I am a woman of color, a black woman—surprise, surprise. But I feel like I can be better at conversations and technology because of my experiences. Because I understand that technology isn't seen as the Holy Grail to a lot of people. There is a lot of resistance. This obsession with production and reading—it creates this complex that those people producing that content know everything.</p><p>Yes, there's learning, there's smartness. But, at the end of the day, you're building consumer technologies. You need to understand people. Your products aren't falling into your hands. They're not falling into the hands of highly educated folks all the time. Or people who are highly connected, highly knowledgeable about who's who in technology.</p><p>So with that in mind, you need to start to immersing yourself—you just need to be a student of culture. You need to understand, what is people's relationship with technology? What is their relationship to the world around them? Because, aside from the capitalistic part of building businesses, at the end of the day, tech was meant to solve problems. And if that was \"the mission,\" how are you going to solve problems if you don't even know what problems are out there, if you don't know how different people experience those problems?</p><p>This obsession with reading or always, you know, producing, versus taking time to understand your bias and stepping out of being so intellectual all the time so that it humbles you. Tech could use a lot of humility. When you're not super humble, you're going to be less susceptible to listening to the other person's point of view.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>At the end of the day, tech was meant to solve problems. And if that was “the mission,” how are you going to solve problems if you don’t even know what problems are out there, if you don’t know how different people experience those problems?<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Yeah, there's this ivory tower mentality around pure reason and rationality and a lack of empathy and compassion.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>And I feel like that's horrible when building systems because you will not let in anything that doesn't fit or filter through that rationality, that black-and-white lens. The world is not fucking black and white—pardon my French—it is not black and white. We as humans are not black and white. Just how you can have a really good but also really shitty day, right in one sitting. That's nuanced. We're nuanced as individuals. Just because you're a good person doesn't mean you're incapable of harming others, right?</p><p>I think it's important to be reminded that rationality isn't going to always be the solution and the answer. And again, you're dealing with complex individuals such as people. For me, learning myself, learning my bias, helps me be a better technologist. Sitting in different communities, understanding their relationships with technology. Understanding their perspectives on how they feel empowered or disabled by, you know, tech or access to tech.</p><p>Lately, more and more,&nbsp;I've been spending my time just seeing, how am I built? You know, how am I building? What are the inherent biases that I bring when I build things, when I create things? The assumptions that I make?</p><p>It was so funny—I was talking to a family member, and I was telling the family that I wanted to do Uber, and they're like, \"No, you're going to get robbed,\" and it's like, \"Oh!\" That was the mindset—if you have strangers in your car, you're going to get robbed. If I'm not even thinking about a person having that view—if I'm assuming that my solution is the best solution—\"why don't you want it?\" I'm not going to probe to make it more human-centered. I'm not going to think about the human side of it and what the reluctance might be.</p><p>We need to create spaces in which our pride isn't just constantly fueled, but our humility as well, our understanding of other cultures, our understanding of ourselves. I hate to sound so zen, but yeah, you should know yourself. You should know how you present your biases your assumptions into the technology that you build, into the ways that you communicate, into the ways that you are open to feedback, because I think, in having this view about output, you're going to start to disrespect people—not disrespect, but create a block with—people who might not fit that like that pattern, essentially. Then you miss out on feedback from peers or colleagues who may not have the same view.</p><p>You respect people who operate like you do, right? You're going to be more likely to do that, so then if I'm the person who's out there, you know, fascinated by culture, and my output looks differently, because I'm inherently \"different,\" you, as a creator and producer and engineer, might not take my words as holding weight. So I think that's another kind of sad byproduct of this attitude. It doesn't lend itself to communication because that person's going to think they're right, and the only people to whom they will be willing listen are the very people who live like them and operate like them.</p><p>For me, personally, it's huge to just not idolize tech as the end-all, be-all, and I have manifested that in my life. Yes, I'm a passionate advocate for tech and really love tech, but at the same time, tech isn't it all. When you operate from the understanding that this very industry is everything, and it's indestructible, you're going to build like that, too, from a place of pride, so I think it's important having different components of my life reflect the view that there's more to life than the tech that we build and the tech conversations that we have and the savior complex that we have around tech becoming a solution for everything.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Okay, so one last question, then, just to wrap on a positive-ish note. What is something that excites you a lot about technology, either in the industry or in society as a whole?</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>It's so vain. So there's two—I I feel like black Twitter just brings me joy. In such a bleak and crazy world sometimes, humor and joy, this shared culture between human beings who relate to you and share content with you even when you're not in that particular geography, but you have this shared communication.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, meme culture is really good for so much. It's a binding cultural force.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>It's so simple! Like wow, let me get in on the conversation. You're not looking at, like, \"Who is this person who shared this meme? What is their PhD in design?\" And yada, yada. You're just like, \"That's funny. I like it. You were clever.\" Faves, bookmarks, you know.</p><p>I'm excited at connection as a force for good rather than for harm. I think it's a good time. I think it's a good time to be a genuinely good human. People are tired of the systems that be, and there's room for fresh perspectives, fresh voices, new narratives. So I think it's just a good time to be creating.</p><p>I don't know, I feel super privileged! I know we take these spaces for granted, but I think about, \"Wow, this tech-enabled tool\"—I mean, don't get me wrong, there's hustle, there's whatever, but—\"Wow, this tool enabled me to create a life I'd never imagined.\" So how many more lives can create? How many more visions can it expand? I think that's really important and exciting. And some folks are listening, powerful folks are listening, to people saying, \"Things have got to change. Things have got to be altered.\"</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>I know we take these spaces for granted, but I think about, “Wow, this tool enabled me to create a life I’d never imagined.” So how many more lives can create? How many more visions can it expand?<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>In terms of tech that excites me, I think more companies around financial tech. Helping empower and enable people with your technology, like Tiffani [Ashley Bell]&nbsp;with the <a href=\"https://www.detroitwaterproject.org/\">Detroit Water Project</a>—it's simple, but how do we solve needs for everyone? Basic human rights. I think about the gig economy in how it means that people have options. I guess the gig economy has its flaws, but that's so exciting to me, that someone can have another line of income in such a crazy, volatile economy. I'm excited about how that evolves and how we enabled more people to build different forms of capital.</p><p>There's just a lot of new tech, new conversations. I don't know I feel about crypto, but I feel like there is a huge opportunity with anything that's trying to disrupt the old guards. It lends itself to thinking, \"If we can try and disrupt this area, what others can we try and disrupt?\" It gets the glimmer in people's eyes—maybe there is some energy and time we should put into it.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><strong>BIANCA</strong></p><p>And then, honestly,&nbsp;the people are what make me most excited about this industry. The good people. Not even trying to, you know, hype you up, but like you. You're like, \"Let's have these different conversations, use our access, use our privilege, introduce new conversations.\" The people restore my hope because I—and a lot of other folks who hustle—we have to make tech that not only enables us, but that enables other people, too. The people who are now feeling empowered to build tech and the solutions—they care. So I'm just excited that the keys are getting into more hands. Yeah, it's good. I hope people stay optimistic. It's not all bad.</p>\n</div>"

What are some ways you think that that applies?</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>It applies to everything! From your health to how you apply for and get selected for jobs. Every facet of your life is touched by technology, and if you don't have a seat at the table when those things are being built, they will not be built for you as a use case.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>Every facet of your life is touched by technology, and if you don’t have a seat at the table when those things are being built, they will not be built for you as a use case.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Which is already happening—</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Which is already happening!</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>All the time.</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Right? So my favorite example of this is when the Apple HealthKit was first launched and there wasn't an app for period tracking. Like, half of the population are women, and they—depending on their age, may no longer or not yet—but everyone at some point has to deal with their period. And most women have some sort of an issue with their period; it's painful, it's irregular, whatever. Very few people have a completely normal, tolerable period. And yet—and, you know, it related to fertility and all these other things—you didn't even think to check if that was something you should build into your tracker! Everything else you're building is sort of like a nice-to-have. This is a real thing that women need. This is a painkiller, not a vitamin. And it never even occurred to you to include it. Or I see the Withings scale doesn't have a setting for, \"I'm pregnant.\"</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Oh, interesting.</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>So I had a pregnant friend who—you know, it tweets your weight every once a week or something, as a committing mechanism or something—and she got pregnant!</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>\"Wow, you're gaining so much weight!\"</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Right! And it kept sending her these emails, like, \"Don't give up! I know you've gained fifteen pounds, but you can fix—\" And she was like, \"Seriously? There's no pregnancy setting! I want to gain weight for the next nine months. Leave me the fuck alone!\"</p><p>And so those are tiny little things, right? You can opt out of a tweeting scale, you can opt out of a tracker, but when you're thinking about medical research that assumes the default use case or the default research subject is a white male, and then things like implantable devices for your heart or for whatever else—they don't build the women's model, right, or they don't think about differences in women's health that might not—a setting or a symptom in a man that wouldn't be a sign of anything but in a woman would be—none of that gets included—that becomes a problem. And you look at how you apply for jobs and what the language is that people put in job descriptions and all of the filters—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Ninjas, rockstars.</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Yeah! And equally the filters that they apply. I mean, you're a perfect example of this. You don't have a computer science degree. But you are a great—right? I'm assuming—engineer. At certain jobs, if you are to apply for them, you won't make the filter because you don't have a degree, whether or not you have the skill.</p><p>So one of the big things that I always talk about in my diversity and inclusion talk is thinking about a multiplicity of onramps and offramps. And thinking about—it's not just one pipeline where if you miss learning about coding at twelve and you don't tinker and hack all through high school so that you know you should major in college and you get that degree from Stanford at twenty-two, you're now shit-outta-luck on participating in the future, right? That's one path. And that's a great path. For some people. That's not realistic for a lot of other people.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It's interesting how—I don't know, there's this sort of aversion to hiring people who are doing bootcamps and stuff. And to some extent, I understand it because it's certainly a different education than you would get in school that's very heavily algorithms-focused—but I think part of it is also, you know, the brand naming and people feeling like it's a shortcut into this thing that I went to MIT or whatever for.</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Well, it's funny because—so, you know, in a place that claims to be a meritocracy. In that same ecosystem, they love so much the shorthands for the hero myth. You see this in every founder story when they get written up in TechCrunch—I can't even read them anymore. It always requires a top-tier school, some sort of job—if you've had a job before—that validates you're brilliant, like a McKinsey or a Goldman—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Google.</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Or Google. A core problem that you've been suffering for in some way your whole life. A \"There must be a better way!\" Right? Then, boom, this totally obvious solution that, like, by the way, fifteen other startups have already tried and failed at, but whatever, right? And no one—that mythology, that founder's hero's journey, is so templated at this point that it doesn't allow for—for instance, if you're a black entrepreneur, part of your hero's journey has to have required you to have struggled and suffered from a low-income, preferably single-parent family to get to where you are. And if you happen to be a well-off black entrepreneur who had two parents and didn't struggle—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>\"Not interesting, doesn't fit my narrative.\"</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>It doesn't fit the narrative! There was a black male founder who <em>Inc.</em>&nbsp;wanted to profile, and when they found his story, which didn't include a lot of suffering, they said, \"Well, this doesn't really fit the story we were looking to tell,\" and they didn't write about him.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. That's crazy.</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>And so we have these standards of MIT or Stanford or the CS degree or whatever, unless you're a white man and then you can drop out of those programs. That gives us the shorthand for, \"You're in my group. You will fit in, I understand you and your problems, we're going to be fine.\" And if you say, \"Look, I dropped out of college as a single mom, and then I learned these skills on my own, and I have no degree to prove to you that I can do it except if, I don't know, you give me a project and I will do it for you.\" Like, that requires cognitive load, right? That requires effort on your part to understand this person who doesn't look like you. And I would argue that that makes for a much better team and a much better hire than the stamped diploma, but it requires more effort.<br /><br />I think the key to all of this is the multiplicity of onramps and offramps that allow for fifty different life paths that still get you to this same place because it says you're going to see things that I don't. Right? My blind spots and my biases are actually my Achilles' heel as an entrepreneur, and if I don't hire people who see where I don't and who questions the things that I take for truth and fact when they aren't, I'm literally building holes into my product or my business plan or my whatever that, at some point, will become problematic. As we are seeing with Uber. Their culture is problematic. Not just for the people who work there, but for the people who use their service. And it will bring them down.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>There was—I don't know if you saw this report, but Uber and Lyft had done a survey or something and realized that drivers would drive female passengers longer and keep them in the car for longer periods of time, just on average, because, you know, whatever. And how surprised can you really be? Or like Airbnb with racism. There was <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Airbnb-host-cancel-reservation-Asian-SoCal-woman-11056023.php\">that woman</a>.</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Oh, man, yes. Who had her Tahoe place canceled.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yes! How shocking can it be that these factors in the real world are going to exist in your platform unless you actively correct for them?</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>And this is also the problem with all of the \"future\" being built roughly in Silicon Valley. I mean, New York is certainly fighting for their fair share of the work, and Boston as well, but it really is mostly Silicon Valley. That enclave is a bubble within a bubble within a bubble. Right? Silicon Valley within San Francisco within California, which is already the most progressive state in the union.<br /><br />So if you're trying to understand, solve for, and be prepared for customer problems, user profiles, issues that you're going to have with customer service, thinking about America as a whole—and, quite frankly, the world if you're a global company—and you're only in this bubble within a bubble within a bubble—even if you hire diverse people, at some point, they still converge in their viewpoints of what the issue is or how many personas to plan for or whatever.</p><p>There's a great article in the <em>MIT Technology Review</em>—I think it's from 2014—it's called something like <a href=\"http://miter.mit.edu/the-unexotic-underclass/\">\"The Unexotic Underclass.\"</a> If you can't find it, let me know, I can send it to you. It's this amazing article that basically talks about the complete flyover states and how they've been abandoned by technology and how the issues that they face, the price points they can afford, the problems that no one's solving for them, are real problems with a giant customer base that could provide a really good business to someone who's willing to solve them. And particularly as you're thinking about sort of—it's not poverty level, but it's working class-ish—population and veterans.<br /><br />Veterans are hugely overlooked in terms of the resources, the support, all of—if you just wanted to focus on veterans, as a customer base, you could have a good business right now—and how they're being overlooked in terms of customers, but they're also being overlooked in terms of employees and the people kind of contribute to the building of this, and if you're willing to hire remote people, if you can have a second office in St. Louis or Minneapolis or Detroit or Kansas City, and you hire people who are from these communities, you're going to have a much more robust business, and you're going to solve real problems. Which, quite frankly, is what I am actually interested in. Yes, I would like to have a lot of money that I can then put toward causes that I care about and electing people who I think should actually be leading the country, all the things that you get when you have an influx of capital, but what I actually care about are solving problems. For real people. And not outsourcing the jobs that my mom used to do for me that I no longer want to do and now that I have enough money I can pay someone to do them for me. Right? Like, that's not—that's not making the world a better place, as Silicon Valley loves to imagine they're doing.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Do you think there's like—I don't know, do you have any thoughts on how to sort of unbundle Silicon Valley, I guess? Because it's sort of a lock-in effect—it feeds into itself, you know?</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Well, so this is the challenge because if you've read Brad Feld's book,&nbsp;<em>Startup Communities</em>, he talks about kind of the three or four pieces you have to have to really build a startup community, right? You have to have capital—and specifically—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>He's based in Boulder?</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Yeah, he's based in Boulder. Specifically, capital that is risk-tolerant, right? So early-stage investors—you need the angel and seed investors. You need the founders, the entrepreneurs. You need usually a university or some sort of academic situation where you get an influx of new people on a regular basis. You have the resources of engineering or science facilities, which are the benefit of that university town piece. And then you need creatives. And that kind of mix of the business, the founders, the creatives, and then the capital—and you need the ability for serendipity, so coworking spaces, mentors, right—this is the mix that makes it possible.<br /><br />So if you look at a Detroit, which has been trying to become the next Boulder for five years now and is not really making it—they have some founders. They sort of have the university piece, but really that's in Ann Arbor, which is over an hour away, and there's no public transit that gets you between them. You have capital, but not really risk-tolerant capital. These are people who made their money the old-fashioned way, and they don't understand what early-stage risk looks like. You don't have serendipity because you have lots of really cheap space that—everyone can get their own office, and they can be all spread out in suburbia.</p><p><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2012/09/21/dan-gilbert-detroit/\">Dan Gilbert's</a> trying to make this happen, but he's doing it with such a heavy hand where only the people that Dan Gilbert invests in get access to the subsidized housing and the cool DVP coworking space and the security on their blocks but not the other blocks... it's really kind of sketch, actually. So Detroit can't quite figure it out, right? And Las Vegas—<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/516526/zappos-ceo-bets-350-million-on-a-las-vegas-startup-scene/\">Tony Hsieh's</a> been trying to do it there. Central planning of serendipity does not seem to be going well. But! I do think you can build this if investors are willing to look at it and ideally move to the middle of the country.<br /><br />So the guy who wrote <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>, J.D. Vance—have you read this book? It's been blowing up.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>I don't think so.</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>He came from the hollers of Ohio and Kentucky and wrote this book—which I take issue with in a couple ways, but it's very similar to my upbringing, so I connected in that way. Anyway, he went off to Yale Law, he became an investor at Kleiner Perkins, and he moved to Silicon Valley, and everyone's like, \"Dude! Dude!\" Anyway, he just announced a month ago that he's moving to Ohio. He's staying part of Kleiner, but he's moving to Ohio to look at and invest in startup in the midwest. Which is amazing! Right? So we need fifty more of those. Because there is entrepreneurial talent, but you need the investors that take them seriously and, ideally, you need investors like J.D. who come from these communities and can recognize problems, right?<br /><br />So when I was trying to fundraise for my first company, Quincy Apparel, we were fixing a problem around how women's clothes fit or, in our case, don't fit their bodies. And we were pitching to all of these men. This was, you know, six years ago now, and there were a lot fewer women investors than there are now, and we realized after four or five months of unsuccessful fundraising how much effort we had to put into educating them that this was actually a problem. Because they were like, \"Well, I don't have any problem buying suits,\" and I was like, \"First of all, you don't have boobs. Or a butt. But secondly, you have more variation in sizing for men's suits than women do. You get to buy a 44 long for a jacket and a 34-32 for pants. I buy an 8.\" Right? I have more variation in my body and less precision in my sizes. So we had to spend all this time even convincing them that there was a problem we knew existed.<br /><br />And you're going to see the same thing as you're trying to get out of the Valley. When the investors only see the same problems that the founders see, and you've got someone new that says, \"No, no, no, for real, there's a problem over here!\" And they're like, \"Mmm, is that really a problem? It's not a problem for me.\" Right? If you're thinking about access to banking services for lower-income people who can't wait three days for a check to clear or who need to be able to take out money in increments less than $20 at a time. Or who need—if you look at a lot of the frustration with—I think it was the New York state legislation where they wanted to shut down payday lenders. And they were like, \"They're ripping off poor people! It's ridiculous percentages they're charging—they should shut them down.\"</p><p>And you're like, \"Yes, from the outside, those are worse choices than banks!\" But if you look at the requirements that banks require in terms of minimum amount of money in your account or the fees they charge you if you don't meet that, the three days of waiting for your check to clear—all of these problems and then you look at payday lenders, where a lot of times people just need liquidity for twenty-four hours, for forty-eight hours, and they're willing—these places stay in business not because they rip people off and no one knows, but because they actually do provide the service that people need at a price they are willing to pay.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>If you personally don’t have an issue with liquidity for three days while your multi-thousand dollar check clears, then you don’t even recognize where the gap in the market is. So it’s a huge, intractable problem, right?<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Now, do I think it should cost that much to have access to banking? No. But if you personally don't have an issue with liquidity for three days while your multi-thousand dollar check clears, then you don't even recognize where the gap in the market is. So it's a huge, intractable problem, right? That on one hand makes everyone want to throw up their hands, but on the other, I think that if there were institutional investors that said, \"We actually care a lot about this,\" and the retirement funds, the pension funds, say, \"We're going to put money behind a VC fund that is going to invest in our local community in the Midwest or in the South or in entrepreneurs that come from these types of backgrounds—not because charity, but because we think there's an untapped market that they have an advantage in seeing,\" then you'll have investors willing to look there, and you'll have entrepreneurs that are willing to sort of build—not willing, but able to—finally build a venture-backed company, versus a cash-flow—I hate the term—lifestyle business. But still, cash-flow-based business.<br /><br />You see a lot of women entrepreneurs; more than fifty percent of small business owners are women. But a lot of these are cash-flow businesses. They're very small, and they deliver a decent life for them. If they knew they had access to capital and could actually build a slightly different business plan that was based on the venture model—which is, I'm going to lose money for a while while I scale very quickly, and then I will reap it later—I think you would see a lot of existing female entrepreneurs that are able to shoot for the high-scale, much bigger kind of vision business, rather than the smaller one. I mean, look at Spanx. Sara Blakely started that with $5,000 of her own money; she's never taken outside investment. That's the reason she's the youngest female billionaire in the world. That totally could have been a venture-backed business, if any VC out there could recognize that women wanted something to smooth without having to wear—I don't know what else to use—without having to wear full-on tights all the time. But what man knows that that's a problem?!? Right? So I don't know.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Well, okay, that's one assumption, though, that I feel like is interesting, that scale is this necessary, unambiguously good thing.</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Yeah! Seriously. That's a great assumption to question, as we look at places like Fab, that are like, \"You scaled! Checkmark. But you failed at all seven business models you've tried to employ.\" No, I think that's right, I think certainly the scale at all costs and—arguably—the \"I have no business model for cash-flow or real cash-flow that's going to add any point recoup the invested capital, and yet I'm going to go IPO.\" Hello, Snapchat! Or Twitter, for that matter.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>This notion of the user who’s going to perpetually give you their personal information so that you can better and better target them, that you can sell that off—that is not in perpetuity a real, sustainable business. And in the meantime, what else have you got to show?<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>I went to business school; I studied the fundamentals of business. By the way, I was there during the entire financial crisis, so we got down to the roots of why things fell apart with the housing crisis, and I don't really see how the current attitude in the tech world is that different. Where we're saying, \"I'm going to put all of this pension money into these companies that have no idea who's going to pay them at what point.\"</p><p>Or they do—it's all advertising-based, ad-based, ad-based. But you're like, \"But then who is the product?\" The product is your users. At some point, we're going to get sick of being the product. We're going to either leave these platforms or we're going to use fake names or we're going to use VPN services to hide our—you know, we're getting savvy. This notion of the user who's going to perpetually give you their personal information so that you can better and better target them, that you can sell that off—that is not in perpetuity a real, sustainable business. And in the meantime, what else have you got to show? And yet, investors just keep pouring money in.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Do you think that there are any concrete implications of that?</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>I mean, short of all of this money just, poof, disappearing one day? And, by the way, that's everyone's pension and retirement funds? It's Fidelity and TIAA and CalPERS and all of them? I think that's the short-term implication. It's like, I want to know where my mom's retirement fund is invested because there's a chance that whole thing goes up in flames. I think it's more problematic in that that money isn't being invested in other things that would be productive assets. It's the same notion that I think you look at a lot of real estate tax treatments, and they were originally created—I did a whole class on tax law in business school, and it was super interesting—but they created a lot of these treatments to encourage the reinvestment of funds in productive capital, in assets, that would feasibly creating housing, support businesses, all these things. And instead, a lot of really big real estate investors, including our president, and a bunch of other smart quants on Wall Street just found loopholes and ways to get around rules.<br /><br />And it's the entire notion of the derivatives market on Wall Street. Derivatives are not productive assets. It's side bets on bets. And the fact that they get the same tax treatment as productive assets is amazing to me. So I think there could be a tax law solution for this, but I don't see a political will to do that at all right now. I think it's more problematic that this money isn't being invested in things that could be making real things. That it's being tied up in what is equivalent to gambling, in my head. And a few people are going to end up very wealthy at the end of this. But it's not going to be you, me, and my mom.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>The risk that the founders of Snapchat versus their third employee is not hugely—hundreds of thousands of multiples—different. And yet they will get those different treatments when it all hits the fan.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Even as an early employee at a lot of these places, you're not going to end up with much. I'm all about risk and return being correlated, but the risk that the founders of Snapchat versus their third employee is not hugely—hundreds of thousands of multiples—different. And yet they will get those different treatments when it all hits the fan.</p><p>It's just—it's not—I refrain from saying equitable or fair too often because the entire point of capitalism isn't fairness. I get that. But if I'm looking at it from a moral lens, of what's the role of business in society, there is a point where I say, \"None of this is equitable. None of this is fair.\" And it's hard to reconcile that with, \"Capitalism, whoo! Way better than socialism, I guess.\" But... to which groups? And to what end?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>You were talking earlier about the kinds of problems that aren't being addressed. What are some areas that you maybe think are being overhyped or overemphasized? And also why, I guess? That's another thing I wonder.</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Shouldn't the market correct for that?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah! Don't you want to be, instead of funding yet another machine learning something something, isn't it a better bet theoretically to look for something that people aren't pouring their money into?</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>You would think so, but things like banking for the unbanked is going to be very low margins—but, you know, if you've got a big enough customer base, it's worth it, and there is arguably a big enough customer base for unbanked people, but your profitability per customer is going to be very low. And then just thinking about all the effort of acquisition and churn and whatever, I can see how you're like, \"That's just a hard business to build. I would rather do an easy business to build.\" And so individually everyone makes this collective decision. Right? Overhyped. Honestly, I think VR and AR are overhyped. I know, I know there's something future, it's going to be there, even mixed reality sounds cool. But what problem are you solving for me? I can see the value in terms of training doctors, in surgery, right? Or visualizing a house instead of having to go with a real estate agent.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>These are all pretty niche applications.</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Yeah! And think about the money and the brainpower being poured into virtual reality right now. And I'm just sort of—I'm just a little bit lost as to, like—is this going to solve poverty, homelessness, hunger, political instability?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Even the issues of race and gender—I think that's one thing that VR is supposed to be able to solve—I think it's very questionable whether that's the case. There was this one account of this woman who—I forget. She was playing a game in VR or something, and she was, in VR, identifiably a woman, and she was assaulted.</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Yeah. Great, I don't need to go to another place to be assaulted!</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>This is virtual reality, and you're still getting sexually assaulted with your virtual body.</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>And the arguments I've heard are like, \"Oh, you could go to, for instance, a job interview but disguise yourself as a man.\" And I was like, \"I don't want to! I want to get to a world where you actually value me as a woman, not that I get to virtually put on a disguise so that you'll fucking hire me.\" So yes, I get it, and if truly every man out there was willing to go through a VR experience of what it feels like to be a woman in New York for a day, where the seven firefighters back there on their lunch break just ogled the two of us as we walked by, and that's just normal—maybe that would change things. But do I really think every man is going to buy their VR headset and be like, \"You know what I should do first, before I play <em>Call of Duty</em>? I should experience what it's like to be harassed as a woman.\" Like, they're not going to do that. So it's almost like you're finding the one niche user case to justify why you want to build technology.<br /><br />I think machine learning is going to happen. The age of the cyborgs will come at some point. I think automated driving and automated manufacturing are coming. I think we are wholly unprepared as a society for what happens economically when that is true. And I think this is a perfect use case. The number one career in America is truck driver. They will all lose their jobs when Otto figures out how to truly automate truck driving. What are we planning on doing with them? Are we going to retrain them like the Danish do? Are we going to—there's a lot. They can't afford to buy your apps and your in-app upgrades when they no longer have a job.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>I think machine learning is going to happen. The age of the cyborgs will come at some point. I think automated driving and automated manufacturing are coming. I think we are wholly unprepared as a society for what happens economically when that is true.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>So alongside any technology development, I wish there was some sort of commensurate investment in understanding and preparing for the implications of that technology. I don't want to not develop automated driving just because people will lose their jobs. It's more efficient, it's safer, it's fewer resources. This is a good thing. But we have to be realistic about what it's going to affect and how that affects us collectively, even if you yourself will not lose your job over this. I think—maybe that's what I wish. For each of these things that we're so willing to pour millions of dollars in, billions even, I wish there was a ten or fifteen percent required investment in a nonprofit or academic institution that studied and developed recommendations for the implications of when this technology has succeeded. Because just because we don't want to acknowledge it doesn't mean it's not going to happen.<br /><br />What else is overhyped? I mean, clearly anything involving social, local, or photos, I'm done with. That was done three years ago, but anything even—I tried fashion tech six years ago, and I still see the number of startups that are like, \"We're going to make a sizing recommendation engine for e-commerce.\" I'm like, \"It's not going to work. I can give you fifty thousand reasons why it's not going to work.\"<br /><br />The Internet of Things, I think, has a lot of potential, but related to kind of the question of the implications of it... Someone tweeted this morning, Adrianne Jeffries, she's a tech journalist, \"I wish I had thought of what would happen when I lose my phone when I bought smart lightbulbs.\" Right? And it's such a great example of, you know, there's the less nefarious cases of, \"My phone is fully—the battery is dead, or I lose it, or I break it,\" and then there's the slightly more nefarious cases of, \"I'm hacked!\" Or another country decides to wage warfare on us—not by dropping bombs, but just by turning off the internet. Which sounds like a very simplistic way of saying it, but it is possible—we don't want to challenge anyone to demonstrate. But if your front door lock and your car and your lightbulbs and your pacemaker and all these things can talk to the internet, they can all be hacked, they can be turned off remotely, they can be stolen data from. And if we don't have a better way—a redundancy behind those things—we're going to be screwed. I refuse to touch anything Internet of Things. I won't do it. I have an Alexa in my living room, and even she freaks me out.<br /><br />The example I always point to is when an escalator breaks down, it becomes stairs, and at least you can still get where you're going. When an elevator breaks down, it becomes a coffin, where you can't get in and get out, and you can't go anywhere. I don't want to get in a self-driving car that becomes a coffin. I want to get into a self-driving car that I can still walk up the stairs if, for whatever reason, it stops working as it was designed to work. We need to figure out more safeguards and stairs use cases for anything that we expect to be connected to the internet.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Do you worry about any of the—I don't know, more doomsday AI scenarios?</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>I do. I honestly do. Simply because of where we started this conversation, which is, \"Who's doing the designing? And what defaults and biases are they programming in them?\" And I think, you know, there was a great—I'm trying to remember where I read this example. There was an example of how minimum sentencing guidelines that are provided to judges—I think this was in a state level or circuit level—I don't think it was national—were based on recidivism rates. And so they—it's related to \"crack is judged more harshly than cocaine\"—people who do this type of crime are more likely to do another crime later, and so we should punish them more harshly the first time. And there was a woman mathematician, maybe in Chicago, who dug into this and she was looking at like, \"Well, where did that data come from?\" And basically the question that I wish more people would ask is, \"In what way is this data biased?\" Because the assumption is that data is truth, and that's just not accurate.<br /><br />All data is biased in some way, and you need to know in what way it's biased so that you can then control for it. So they looked into these recidivism rates, and I forget what the big \"aha\" was, but basically they had taken a very skewed racial-based kind of historical records that discriminated against black men the first time around were more likely to rearrest them when something happened, and therefore that created these higher recidivism rates, which then reinforced stronger sentencing guidelines. Right? So it became like this perpetual cycle. All of which was based on biased data. And if they would just acknowledge the biased data, they could adjust for it, but they didn't.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>All data is biased in some way, and you need to know in what way it’s biased so that you can then control for it.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>So I wish with all things AI, there was research into unconscious bias and the research methods that every social scientist has to learn in, you know, their masters program, included controlling for bias, researching into bias, and creating new ways of presenting data, recording, and sort of adjusting for bias, in all these things, so when you're building artificial intelligence on top of those data sets, you are starting with a much clearer understanding of where you're starting from. And then it requires, I would argue, a diversity of engineers working on the AI projects to then understand what biases they're bringing to the table.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>I always wonder with, for instance, Apple HealthKit. Were there women on this team, and then they were like, \"Hey, should we throw in some stuff about periods?\" and then people were like, \"No, that's super niche.\"</p><p><strong>CHRISTINA</strong></p><p>Super niche! Only half of the country is relevant for it. Or! Were they too afraid to speak up because they didn't want to have to be the only woman on the team who brought up the women's issue, right? Which is just as problematic because there's tons of research that shows that minorities, both racial and gender, who talk about diversity at work are dinged. So you can't talk about it—but you're the only one who's imagining and thinking and understanding those opportunities that everyone else is missing. And so you're in this catch-22. I do wonder if there were any women on that team.<br /><br />No, I wish, especially for things like AI—and I know this is the exact opposite of the entire Silicon Valley ethos of run fast, break things, iterate, beta test, all the things, ship code, I get it—I wish, though, that there were some—imagine if we developed drugs that way. Imagine if pharma worked this way, where they were like, \"I got a molecule! Let's rush to production, let's inject it into a bunch of people! We think it solves problems—oops, it accidentally killed 90% of the people we gave it to. Oh, well, we're just—that was the beta. It's just the beta, we're going to iterate.\"<br /><br />And I know that apps aren't the same as cancer medication. But in some ways, especially around AI and machine learning, the outcomes that they are building toward, the future they are building for, will have just as much of an impact on people as the medication that they take. And I wish there was some sort of industry review board or external kind of board that you had to submit your code to, that you had to submit your research tests to and say, \"This is where we got our data, these were the experiments we ran, this is what we understand about our biases.\" And that they could be like, \"Yes, you're ready to launch!\" or, \"Nope, you've completely ignored this entire group. I want to come back and I want you to address how it's going to affect them.\" And I get it. It's at odds with how we build everything in Silicon Valley. And yet... maybe it shouldn't be. Fast is better for dollars, but I don't know if it's better for society.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>Fast is better for dollars, but I don’t know if it’s better for society.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>"

Do you think it's changed in the last couple of years or so? What do you see as the desired outcome of these kinds of stories?</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">On a small scale, I do think that there's been some forward-pushing that has been really good. Even to just think about the equity gap is a concept that I remember only encountering the first time a few years ago—I think it was Erica Baker?</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">She had already left Google, and she was talking about the salary spreadsheet that she made, and it was really a pivotal time for people to be talking about pay transparency in big tech companies. Maybe it was around then, or soon after that, that she made the point on Twitter that we don't examine equity, that we found this one metric, which was just, \"Let's talk about the pay gap,\" and that was great, and then we had all these conversations about it, and that was it.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I don't know if you listen to the podcast from Rebecca Greenfield,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/the-paycheck\"><em>The Pay Check</em></a>. I really recommend it, not just because I think she's wonderful, but it was a really interesting experience for me to listen to it, even though I feel like I know some about the subject matter. But she brought up the point that equity was really where wealth was made, and I remember thinking at the time, \"Wow, we'll get to that someday.\"</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I'm not saying just because there's been one report and one series of stories about the equity gap that that is now a thing that we discuss and a thing that people accept as a thing, but for all these steps that we have to take to address an issue, first we have to name it, get people to care about it, convince people that it's real.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Have some way to measure it.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yeah, all that. But I think it's cool to get a stamp of, you know, this [problem] is a thing—A Thing—that a few years ago was just an idea and a tweet. To watch that come forth was pretty cool. So I think, in that microcosm, yes. A lot's changed in the period of time that I've been covering this topic, which is not even that long. Five years ago, I was a crime reporter, and I wasn't covering business. So that's exciting.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">But then I don't know, I feel like the mood of seeing so many photos of Anita Hill and Christine Blasey Ford, side by side… it's just hard for me to think that, on a longer term, things are changing. Also, I don't have the right perspective.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">How do you think that equity fell between the cracks? You know, everyone is talking about pay gaps and pay transparency and, for whatever reason, this huge part—</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Because it's so emotional. Sorry to cut you off, but I think because it's not well understood.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">You know, I've never held a job where I had equity. Trying to understand how it worked, as someone without any experience of it, was hard. I think, even if you have a job where you have access to equity, they don't teach you about it. People understand salaries. There's just been so much discussed about how much people should be making; dollars don't change in value over time. Except, well, they do, but not as much as equity.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Part of it is also that it's seen as part of your&nbsp;emotional commitment to the company, and that makes it more taboo to talk about it. I hate that that is something that gets exploited in that way, and I see it over and over again... this idea that if you \"own\" part of a company—and ownership is complicated in its own way when it comes equity, but if you have the option to buy ownership in a company someday, if you have the tax money, and all the pieces fall into place—that's seen as an emotional commitment that I think is higher than should be to your job.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">That's a strong normative statement, but I think people, especially young people, at startups or in companies where they hold stake in the company are vulnerable to getting pulled toward agreeing to things that they shouldn't because they're told, \"Oh, it's your sweat going into this company! You own part of it.\" And it just feels to me that it should be handled more responsibly.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">In particular, I think of examples like WeWork—they make a big show out of how everyone who is an employee at WeWork, all the way from executives to cleaners, has equity in the company. They don't give you any idea of how much it could be worth, or, you know, whether someone who is making the salary that WeWork cleaners do would be able to afford the tax bill that goes with exercising options. You have no way to compare.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I think you were the one who talked to me about it—you have to push for so much information to compare your size of equity to other people, so just saying that you own part of the company becomes this mythical way to turn work into family that I don't think is always used responsibly. I think it's sometimes used in a one-sided way where people who don't have as much information about what it means are then more vulnerable than those who know more and have more experience and have more visibility into how much it's worth.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>Just saying that you own part of the company becomes this mythical way to turn work into family that I don’t think is always used responsibly.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yeah. That's a really good point.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I mean, not that it's bad all the time. It has allowed a lot of people to have so much financial freedom and make really generous life choices.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">But yeah, if it is used to make this sell, that it means that you're more invested in the company and so on, then the lack of transparency accompanying it is bizarre.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yeah, and I think just because it's not the norm to talk about it more, then it becomes this weird topic that you can't discuss. There's just something inherently personal when people have this idea of what it means to work on something that you own, and it's really different from working for the man, where you clock in nine to five.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">But the reality is that your employer is not going to treat you like family in all the same ways that they expect you to treat them, for the most part. There are always exceptions. But I generally feel that many people don't understand that well enough and that, especially if you're young and don't have a lot of work experience, you just might be really swayed by it.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>The reality is that your employer is not going to treat you like family in all the same ways that they expect you to treat them.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Especially if the founder owns twenty, thirty, forty percent of the company, a huge fraction of your labor is exclusively benefiting one person. That's interesting.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Anyway, I wanted to ask about WeWork. I don't know that much about it—I mean, I know enough about it from a cursory point of view, but I don't think about it that often outside of huge mounting valuations and that kind of news. Just because it's not a traditional tech company, right? It's a real estate company with some software. Do you have any thoughts on WeWork as a business and its tactics and what that culture represents in the bigger picture?</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I think you can think about WeWork in two ways. One aspect of what's interesting about WeWork is just how dramatically it has grown in the last eight years. How much money it's raised—even today, there was a story about Softbank. I wasn't here earlier because I was working on that.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">In that sense, it's a really interesting business. Simply for its rapid rise, it has undeniably become one of the biggest and most interesting—I wouldn't call it a startup anymore—private, venture-backed companies of its crop.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">And then I also like to think of it as a culture machine because it is so... I mean, every large tech company ends up with strange, insular, mind-bogglingly self-referential company culture, and I think that happens at Google, at Facebook, at all these places. At WeWork, it's interesting because they're really open about it, and they are so earnest about the way that they present their vision of the world. Even just their slogans—I'm sure by now they have new ones, but they were like, \"Better together,\" \"Do what you love,\" \"Make a life, not a living.\" Hustle is a word they really love.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Anyway, I'm interested in both sides of the company, but I think I find the second one to be more fruitful in thinking about what sort of culture tech is exporting to the greater world. Because if you think about WeWork... you can debate whether it's a tech company, but it's pretty much the essential \"not a real tech company under a tech company banner.\" It's a real estate company.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">But they are in this weird position where they export their culture pretty strongly to anyone who is a tenant or member, right? So if you work in a WeWork, you may not feel moved by the idea of their inspirational slogans on the wall, their beautiful citrus water, but you are nevertheless in their space every day, and you get to learn some part of what they do, and the community manager sends you emails about the happy hours and the free beer and the free snacks on the fifth floor.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I have never worked in a WeWork, although I did live in a WeLive for five days, which was crazy but super interesting.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I didn't know WeLive already existed!</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">It does. It's in two cities. And so there's one in New York and one in DC, and in theory they are building more in Seattle, though my understanding is that it has maybe lost some momentum, but that is at least the plan.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Anyway, WeLive was like WeWork, except WeWork's idea of culture taken even more intensely into a place that is your home. There are a lot of people with interesting thoughts about interior design and the encroaching mass of buildings and spaces and offices and coffee places that all look the same. I wish I had the right vocabulary to describe interior decoration, which I don't.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I was just talking to someone about that the other day, how every tech company looks the same.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I'm going to not say his last name right because I've never met him in person, but <a href=\"http://kylechayka.com/\">Kyle Chayka</a> writes about this topic. I think he may have even written a book about it, but he's all about—</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Tracking homogenous interior design?</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yeah. The relentless march of light wood paneling.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Plants.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Hexagonal light coverings and plants and airy spaces.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Gold accents.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yeah. Gold accents... I'm so guilty of gold accents.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Me, too.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Anyway, as a cultural vehicle, WeWork is pretty powerful in that sense, in that&nbsp; they are doing what a lot of brands do, which is take something that was originally appealing because it was offbeat, like the cool patterns, accent pillows, whatever, and then they put it in every WeWork across a certain region. People don't look at that aspect of them enough, but I think it's important. Because they sell, in theory, community, so all of a sudden there's this really large company that's in the position to be exporting community to many people's workplaces when these workplaces are small and impressionable.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>[WeWork] sells, in theory, community, so all of a sudden there’s this really large company that’s in the position to be exporting community to many people’s workplaces when these workplaces are small and impressionable.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I know plenty of people who have had a workspace in WeWork, and they left because they didn't like the other people, they thought it was too noisy, it was too expensive, they just wanted more space, other more innocuous and less innocuous reasons. It's not like you're forced to do it. But it is interesting that it is becoming by far the most default option. Although there are plenty of rivals that try to do more adult co-working, so in a way it gets shown for what it is by how people differentiate themselves and they're competing against it.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Anyway, none of that was about what you asked, which was about the rise of how big it is, and I think that's more a statement on SoftBank and their appetite. I don't know that I have huge insights there. In terms of the cultural side, then it's interesting, with the slogans, for instance.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">It feels like 2013 or something to me, in terms of the tech industry. I don't know exactly when WeWork started, presumably before that, and so it makes sense that that is the culture that it embodies, but it's fascinating to me that it still does, when I think a lot of the tech industry has slowly started to move away from that, like Facebook no longer has those kinds of slogans everywhere.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">They don't still have the propaganda room?</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I'm not sure! But there's been a kind of backlash in the last couple of years. I'm thinking, for instance, about the Fiver ads on the subway. Do you think that part of their culture can really last?</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">It's possible that they have updated some of the slogans I mentioned, but I wonder if, as you get bigger, it is harder to move as quickly away from an idea that you put into place when you were a fifth of the size that they are now. I mean, I'm making up that number, but my guess is that the growth rate has been about that in terms of number of employees and number of places in between now and 2013.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The \"Hustle\" one, for example, regardless of whether they still have that on X number of walls, in X number of WeWorks, that was one that I remember really embodying to me, similar to what you said about Fiver, this idea that you should be working insanely hard towards something, and sometimes it's not always obvious what the benefit is for you.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I think they meant \"Hustle\" to inspire the [tenants] who work at WeWork, but it was also language and terminology that they used with their some of their lowest-paid workers—not cleaners, but community managers, people who run the offices in WeWorks. Their job is to change the coffee, respond to member emails, whatever—it just runs the gamut, and it's a really hard job, long hours, and there were various labor complaints against them for allegations of not paying proper overtime wages, not paying proper minimum wage based on hours worked, as well as different opinions about what a manager is, not to get into the details too much.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">But the point was, some of these workers who talked to me for the stories felt that the language around \"Hustle,\" and working really hard for the sake of doing your mission and your job, was misused to make them feel like they should be putting more work into their job than they were legally required to do or that they were explicitly asked to do. Illegal amounts of work.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">With WeWork, they are probably in tune with what the sort of changes that you were describing, but I don't know, they still have WeWork summer camp every year, which is like a big festival.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yeah, that's more or less what I mean. It feels like some parts of the tech industry have moved away from like \"Peak Hustle,\" from everything that I read about WeWork, it seems like they're still in that phase, culturally.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I mean, their workforce is a lot more varied, a lot more geographically spread out. If you work in HQ, you're in New York, not usually here, although they have a lot of locations in San Francisco.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">And I can imagine how they're opening in new places where tech is less common, and so \"Hustle\" culture is new there, and it's exciting.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yeah, in all this talk, I think it's important to keep in mind that they're, for example, growing super fast in Asia, and it's hard to know—what feels right for you and me in San Francisco is not necessarily going to be the same elsewhere.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">We're so jaded. So bored of the tech industry.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">We're all just here with our phones on grayscale—like, we're over it. But yeah, I don't pretend to understand what feels cutting-edge elsewhere than my world.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Okay, so I've been thinking a lot, especially in the context of all these stories related to tech employees speaking about poor conditions in the company or unethical practices that the company is doing or whatever, and now is a time when that's surfacing a lot more, more and more frequently. Unfair and unethical behavior keeps getting exposed, but I think the vast majority of people are really afraid to talk to reporters and worried about repercussions, no matter what.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I'm not talking about throwing shade at their current employer or revealing trade secrets or anything like that—even with generic commentary about how much they've been paid in the past, there is this reflexive attitude around, \"Talking about that is bad, something bad will happen.\" Do you think that stance is typical of all industries or particularly the tech industry?</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">For instance, for the equity gap story you wrote, a lot of people were unwilling to talk about instances in which their previous employers discriminated against them, even off the record.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yeah. I mean, I think employers have for decades tried to control flow of information about the company by giving warnings that are sometimes true and sometimes not a hundred percent true about what repercussions you might face. If you talk to the press—obviously I come at this subject with a completely self-interested angle, but I do truly feel that the way that the most important information about what really happens in the tech industry comes to light is when people who are involved in doing it or were involved in doing it share that information on a large platform.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">And that used to be talking to a reporter, but it doesn't have to be. I think Susan Fowler, for example, is maybe the best example of that—she didn't [talk to a reporter], but she just wrote this hugely powerful essay, and the domino effect was undeniable. So it doesn't have to be by going to a reporter, but to me it almost goes back to this feeling of... I'm really fascinated by the way that companies build that feeling of loyalty in their employees.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Having never been someone who's running a company, I'm maybe not in a position to value all the positives about having super-tight loyalty with your employees. But I can imagine that that would be an incredibly powerful force to have within your company.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I'm usually on the other side. I'm trying to get people to do something that is personally risky for them but hopefully feels like it has [importance]. Usually people are idealistically driven if they are willing to take a personal risk to share something for which they might face repercussions. And so usually it's for a good reason—it's not to try to hurt people, but I think that that's often the way it's seen. I would kill to be inside of meetings at Facebook or another big company where they talk about leakers and what that means to the company, not because I think it would be scandalous, but because that's a part of the culture of a company that is so fascinating to me. It does often pit what I think can be a rational choice as an emotional and destructive one. Right?</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Let's say you're in a company where, your entire life, you've been told that talking to the press is a betrayal, hurtful, only used as a way to wreak havoc and revenge. And then you're there, and maybe you witness something that you think is wrong, and you try to go through the internal pathways to get it resolved, and it doesn't get resolved, and you start to lose faith in the systems at your company. I imagine a lot of people are plagued with intense guilt, or they're like, \"Look, I feel like the right decision is to speak out and yet my entire career I've been told that that's something that only terrible people do.\"</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I've absorbed, over the years, snippets of what that emotional bond is like, how it is created in a new employee, how it is sustained, even internally at large companies—the methods employees have to ask comms people about a story that they don't understand. For example, I think it's been reported that Facebook has internal groups where employees can post stories where they're like, \"I don't understand why this story is in the news,\" and the comms team will explain. From the outside perspective, from someone who's never worked at one of those companies, for me to understand how that bond is formed, would be really hard, and I just find it fascinating.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">There's a part of it that is useful. In order to build anything that has high stakes, you need to be able to control information about it, but then in many cases it seems like it's taken a step further where, even if you do something for arguably the right reasons, that goes against what we [the company] want you to do. It's not like we're going to say that that goes against what we want you to do. We're going to say, \"People who do that are bad, people who do that hate the company.\" I don't know, there's just something really human about it. And by no means do I think this pattern is specific to tech; I just think about it all the time.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Well, I guess the way I think about it, I think how it might be different in the tech industry is just that, culturally, the tech industry is so over-the-top. The benefits, the perks, are lavished upon you, and you refer to your CEO on a first-name basis, and—</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Oh my god. Sorry, quick sidenote. I only ever hear people in tech referring to the CEO of their company as \"my CEO,\" which is a phrasing that—I'm not used to it. Like, the person is not CEO of you.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Whoa, yeah.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">They're the CEO of your company. Anyway, sorry, go back. First name is another way to do it.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yeah, and so I feel like it's also that—it creates a sense of guilt, that you've been treated so well, and, in spite of that, you would do something, anything, that the company wouldn't want you to do.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">And, on top of that, again, there have been mission-driven companies for decades and decades, but so much of the pitch to work at a tech company over another, in the end, for in-demand software engineers such as yourself, comes down to, \"Do I feel personally aligned with this mission?\" And so you feel like even more is at stake, that it isn't just a job. It's been said a million times, but it's not just a job; it's your calling. That bond can be great, and it can be really terrible. It's just really powerful, and I think I see it used for good and for bad.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>It’s not just a job; it’s your calling. That bond can be great, and it can be really terrible.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">On the subject of leaking—there was recently an incident with the Google Dragonfly situation, where there was information getting live-tweeted by a journalist, and then the observation impacted what was happening.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Right, they stopped the meeting.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Do you ever think about—I'm sure you do—but do you ever think about whether your reporting can have that impact, and how do you factor that into what you do and don't print? I mean, that was a really specific example.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I think that one is an interesting case because it was, you're right, the observation effect meant that the meeting ended. If you're talking more generally, how do I decide for sources who put themselves at some risk to share information how much guidance to give them, to talk them through that process?</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Well, I meant specifically in the context of leaks—journalists often have this stance that leaks are good because they increase transparency and public pressure, and so it can help a certain cause, but there's another stance of employees with that same cause who are like, \"We have some sway here, and leaks damage our exposure to information, so potentially publishing more information might actually make it harder to achieve our shared goal.\"</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I don't know that I've been in a position that's exactly like that. Usually it's someone who is wrestling with a decision about how much information—either about something on which they worked or of which they have knowledge or about themselves—how much information that they want to be published. I think any responsible journalist would talk [them through it].</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The number one line is that we're not lawyers. We can't give legal advice, and many people who talk to me are people who are talking to press for the first time, and there's no reason to pull anything on these people. You just want to try to give them all the information you can about what might happen. Your responsibility is to make sure that they understand what is going to be published, generally, so that there are no surprises there on the process, and talk them through every definition of \"on background,\" \"not for attribution,\" \"off the record.\" Everyone has different ideas of what these terms mean, and I found that it's not good enough to just say it's on background because people treat that really differently from journalist to journalist.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I feel moved to make sure people understand what that process is like, especially because it's scary to talk reporter, and if it's your first time... I get so anxious worrying that someone is going to feel like I didn't make it clear enough to them what was going to happen. I worry about it all the time. Anyway, separately about publishing stories that might impact the events, I don't know that I've ever personally been in that position.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yeah, that makes sense. To me, it's just interesting that, if one employee has decided to leak, maybe they're not on the same page with other employees who are like,&nbsp; \"Oh, no, we had this trust, and now they won't even tell us what they're going to do.\" It's an interesting tension.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Sure. Yeah.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">So privacy. It is a perennial issue, but lately it's just been every other day that there's a new privacy issue or security breach or whatever. For instance, with Facebook, the fifty million users and the 2FA phone numbers. What do you see as the future of that? Do you think that there will be government regulation, and, if so, how would that impact tech companies? There's now a camp that says, \"Who cares about privacy? That's how the internet has become what it is; people got services for free.\"</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Oh, I think that's a great question because, in the last year or two, I have tried to notice more often— and many people have as well—the behavioral cues that control 40% of my day. That's including my sleeping hours, so a lot of my waking hours.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I'm still mad about the 2FA incident with Facebook. Facebook wants your phone number for a lot of reasons. And I think Kashmir Hill has done incredible <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/facebook-is-giving-advertisers-access-to-your-shadow-co-1828476051\">reporting</a> about what ways Facebook can use even snippets of information by you that you don't even provide to them, that other people provide to them on your behalf, to map out every person you've ever met, the people you know, what you're likely to want, how to show you ads, and all that. So I highly recommend her work.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Knowing that and then receiving prompts over and over again when you're trying to log in to Facebook... You're at a vulnerable time because you just lost access to your account, and you're like, \"Oh, I really want to make sure that doesn't happen again.\" Facebook's like, \"Okay, great, you haven't provided your phone number to us yet. How about you provide your phone number so that you can be sure that you can log in again in the future?\" Which is maybe 2% of the reason why they want your phone number, but they don't say that. I don't know who said it, but design is not neutral. You just know that—</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">People deliberated over it.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Making this word blue and bold and this other word black and not bold is really significant! We don't control [how we perceive this kind of information]. We understand so much less of what our brains are doing than many people realize, and that's a lesson I've had put into my head over and over again. So, zooming back out, when you talk about whether people will care about privacy, I'm not sure it's even important whether they want to care about it because what's more powerful is what everyone else wishes that they would pick. In each little moment where you wonder if you should give your phone number, the easiest way is the way that people will go.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Not that I'm an expert on how to get consumer adoption of privacy, but I imagine one of the better ways to get people to take preventative measures that help keep their digital lives secure isn't by making them care about it; I think it's more powerful to make something that's easier for people to use. A password manager is probably much much more effective at getting people to improve their security online than proselytizing about how important it is to care about personal security.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>We understand so much less of what our brains are doing than many people realize.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Well, so password managers work because people can make money from it, so maybe there's a parallel.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yeah, if it takes having a business model to make someone build a good product, that is good. I'm not opposed to that. I don't think making money off of something is tainted in any way. It's just become more clear to me over time how much less control we have over what decisions we make than we think we do. It's pretty disturbing to think about it every day. Regulation.&nbsp;I don't know. I'm not good on that one.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yeah, I do think making privacy the default is the only way people will act in a way that puts privacy first.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I'd be curious for your thoughts. How do you think companies end up making decisions that go against their short-term self-interest? Do you just have to make it so much more painful for them to go down that path than the other way?</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">One of my housemates here is a behavioral economist, and she just thinks all day about how to get people to do something by either increasing the benefits to doing the action, increasing the risks to not doing the action, and lowering the barriers to doing the action. I mean, it's really basic, and so maybe it's obvious to people, but once you see those three options, I think that's just your first tiny step toward understanding why you do what you do. Removing the barriers to something—that's Netflix auto-play. Increasing the benefits to&nbsp; something—she usually uses an example of that is putting mint in toothpaste. You want people to brush their teeth, so then you also make it refreshing and wonderful. I wish I had a good tech example for that one.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">But you get the idea, right? Once you start to see these patterns, you can do a lot.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I think it's probably making it painful because it will always be the most profitable option to have more data. From an engineering standpoint, it makes your job easier. The more data you have, the more you can do with it. Otherwise, you're just guessing and approximating, and the result is not great. So I think the push, the tendency, will always be toward that. I find it hard to imagine that people would ever have the ideal state be less data to use.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Do you think a stronger penalty is public opinion or regulation, if you think the best mechanism is increasing penalties?</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I don't know. GDPR is a pretty interesting example because I've talked to a couple people about that, and that certainly had an impact. A lot of people I know spent a lot of time building or rebuilding their services to be GDPR-compliant. So, at least to the extent that we ask whether companies will do anything, it worked. I don't know what the end game of that specifically will be—I think we'll have to measure that. But it's one potential interesting case study in five, ten years.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Yeah, that's good. Because I don't have that lens into how much work it took to do it. It does seem like, in the end, it was, at least on paper, an effective enforcer. Work was done.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">People spent time on it.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Companies sent the emails we all received. I think revisiting in a few years, figuring out whether it had the intended long-term effect, would be fascinating.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Okay, so I usually ask one more question. I always try to end these conversations on a more positive note because they can get pretty bleak sometimes. Is there anything in tech that excites you right now?</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>ELLEN</strong></p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I'm pulling a blank. Sometimes I still think about this moment that I had a few years ago where I was going to travel overseas and I was like, \"I wish I could download Google's maps ahead of time so that I didn't have to use data when traveling to figure out where I was going.\" Somehow it came up in conversation, and someone was like, \"Oh, that already exists.\" And it's such a wonderful product. I use it all the time. Every time I use it, I'm so happy. It is exactly what I want—specifically offline. Just specifically.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I remember I had some shitty workaround where I would load the route ahead of time, then I would keep it open in the car, and then inevitably if you made a wrong turn it wouldn't redirect properly because it didn't have access to the internet. So maybe it's the little joys like that.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>The things that a technology can help you do today are the things that you need it to do for you tomorrow, and I hate that cycle.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">But, then, see, even Google Maps is problematic! They track everything. I turned off all my location-tracking on Google Maps, and even then I'm worried that I missed something. What a disappointing answer.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I do think people people build tools that are really useful to other humans, and we didn't have access to them before, but as soon as I'm saying that, I'm already thinking—the things that a technology can help you do today are the things that you need it to do for you tomorrow, and I hate that cycle. I hate that, like, I grew up reading paper maps with my mom when I was a kid. My mom showed me how to flip over the map and look for the street name, and we would go and plot it out on the map. It was an interesting skill that I had, an experience that people born even five or ten years after me are never going to have, and our dependency makes me despair sometimes, but maybe that's just the nature of the world. Maybe that's the nature of tools like Google Maps.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">It is undeniably a wonderful product that has helped so many people in a moment of need. But the tech line of, \"Well, the good outweighs the bad...\" I mean, that's a whole other discussion—we can dissect that another time. That has been discussed a lot lately because that was a line that came up in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/david-marcus/the-other-side-of-the-story/10157815319244148/\">David Marcus's response</a> to the WhatsApp story, with Brian Acton. He said that the good outweighs the bad. That was a really interesting statement. If you ever want to talk about the rhetoric of Facebook executives, I would love to talk more about that someday.</p>\n</div>"

He led consumer product management at YouTube and worked on building Second Life at Linden Labs.</h3><h3>We met at the Homebrew office when I first moved back to San Francisco, and Hunter talked to me about his philosophy of bottom-up investing, addressing unconscious bias, and the work culture in Silicon Valley.</h3>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>So one thing I wanted to ask was about this idea of bottom-up investing and what that means to you and what you see as the counter to that, which I'm assuming is the norm for VC.</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>I think it's more a philosophy about technology than it is a philosophy about investing. So when we think about what bottom-up economy means to us, it's a belief that one of the most powerful uses of technology is to empower, enable, and open up, whether it be individuals, marketplaces, access to information. As we leave behind or have left behind industrial capitalism (factories, production lines, high infrastructure costs) and move to technology-driven capitalism, that has a lot of attributes and characteristics, many of which excite us.<br /><br />I'd say that how that influences our investing is that we think some of the most exciting opportunities are not about technology benefitting just the wealthiest consumers or largest companies, but essentially giving new types of marketplaces, revenue streams, data efficiencies, and access to those to a broader set of consumers and to a broader set of businesses, including what's called the business of one, individuals as economic units.<br /><br />Even within the largest companies, more and more enterprise software is sold less as a compliance tool that's purchased by the CEO, CTO, CIO, you know, head of HR, whatever, and more as something that individuals, teams, and managers are bringing into their organizations. You might eventually, as a company, use that bottom-up penetration to sell a large enterprise-wide license. So it might still end up being a large line item on which the CTO signs off, but it was brought into the org on people's phones, by a VP who was like, \"Well, I've got spending authority up to $50,000... This tool is going to help me and my sales team coordinate. I'm going to buy it.\" Versus the old days of Gartner Group and how many steak dinners you can have with the CIO before signing a five-year agreement, stuff like that.<br /><br />One of the things that Satya and I were discussing even before the fund took shape was, \"Hey, this is a trend we think is an enduring aspect of a multi-decade economic cycle, and whatever we do, investing or otherwise, is probably going to have some aspects of this to it.\" And then once we decided to do Homebrew, you know, it became just one of our guideposts on how we understand the types of companies for which we might be the right fit.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, it's interesting that you mentioned not addressing the wealthiest markets. I talked about that with Christina Wallace, someone in New York, and one thing that matters a lot to her is the idea that tech companies always address the same problems, and anything that's out of that—she did a clothing company at some point and couldn't convince VCs that it was a problem that women couldn't find the right sizes. And the wider, across-America take, on not addressing other parts of the country.</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>Two things twitch for me when you say that. The first is, when we joke when we do consumer stuff that we're low on Maslow's hierarchy—food, water, shelter. There's plenty of obviously amazing businesses built around luxury goods or more discretionary goods, but it hasn't been, by and large, where we've found ourselves or found ourselves pulled. And that's fine. It's not a judgment on those businesses—it's just, we ask ourselves the question, \"Do we think this is a good place for our capital?\", or, \"Do we want to get up every morning and put sweat and reputation behind this company and its mission?\" And if the answer's no for some reason, it's not a judgment on the validity of the business, it's a personal judgment on whether we're the right investor.<br /><br />You know, I believe the best founders bring a hundred percent of themselves to their businesses, and especially at the seed stage, if you're bringing investors to the table in a lead role who can't equally be a hundred percent committed, those investors should have enough self-awareness to say, \"You know what, I don't think I'm the right investor. Even if I could make money here, I'm not the person who's going to be the most useful to your company.\" And so we step back from those opportunities.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>We get excited about missionary founders who believe that the world is going to be better because of what they’re building, but that doesn’t mean that they’re doing necessarily double bottom line businesses or that they’re working only in health and education.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Some people say, \"Well, you know, I only want to invest in things that make the world a better place.\" But that's a subjective and personal decision, and so I find it difficult. What I say is, we get excited about missionary founders who believe that the world is going to be better because of what they're building, but that doesn't mean that they're doing necessarily double bottom line businesses or that they're working only in health and education. I had my own experiences working at YouTube, working at AdSense, working at SecondLife—I believe the world was better for the work we were doing, even though I knew I wasn't curing homelessness.<br /><br />So there's very few areas—even if a founder believes that, let's say, for cash-based fantasy sports, \"The world's a better place because we're providing entertainment...\" I get that. I'm not sure I have the conviction around that, and it's hard for me to get excited around that, so I'm probably not the right investor, but I don't believe you're fundamentally wrong or kidding yourself.<br /><br />There can also be a reflexive response to the question \"Is that a tech company or not?\" As software permeates every industry we're going to see every—or almost every—business become somewhat of a \"tech company,\" but it's on a spectrum. There are businesses where the innovation is occurring primarily in building a new type of technology, and then there are going to be companies where the technology allows them to be successful, and they couldn't have existed even just a few years ago, but fundamentally they're more tech-enabled than taking on true technology risk. Both types can be successful. Both types can be great venture businesses.<br /><br />Technology-enabled companies could not do what they're doing without the presence of technology, and there's also often great technology there—that's not to say, \"Oh, that's where the junior league is.\" But they move within a fixed spectrum of what technology can do for them. So, like, a fashion company that sells online uses technology to manage their inventory more effectively than maybe people used to do, communicates with customers through multiple channels—there's all these things that they couldn't have done twenty years ago, but it's not going to fundamentally change the fact that cotton costs money, and making clothes costs money, and your margins are probably not going to look like Google's. Convincing yourself otherwise as an entrepreneur or venture investor is dangerous because you end up overfunding the company and trying to turn it into something it's not.<br /><br />Venture is traditionally about winner-take-all, winner-take-most markets, where the ability to spend risk capital well ahead of realizing profits or taking profits leads to a bigger outcome and larger enterprise value. There's a lot of technology-enabled companies that can still be really, really valuable and venture-backed but shouldn't necessarily operate on that same set of constraints. So when we invest in technology-enabled companies versus technology companies, we also want to invest in founders who are going to grow their companies in a way that's consistent with the fundamental physics of their business, which is, \"This is going to be a forty to sixty percent margin. This is not a ninety-eight-percent margin business. This company is ultimately going to trade at 4x revenue, not 20x revenue.\"<br /><br />So even, I think, when there's a venture investor who \"gets\" the problem—as opposed to, is oblivious to it—I think you still need to have honest conversations with the founders about what they believe to be true about the financial profile of this business over time, rather than just blindly believing that anything that uses technology is going to be unencumbered by the realities of their business model. Jeff Kearl, who started Stance Socks among other companies, always says the most important decision a founder makes is within what market they want to work. Because those markets have fundamental truths. And there's a reason he chose socks. And they're doing really well, but he chose it deliberately based on a set of things he thought he could capitalize versus other markets in which he could work.</p><p>I think the best investors are interested in having their eyes opened by entrepreneurs to problems they didn't know existed. But then regardless of that discovery process, they are able to have consistent structural conversations with the founder to understand whether, by that VC's definition, it's a venture-scale business or not. And in the Valley in particular, we do too good a job at marketing venture as <em>the </em>capital with which to start your business.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>I think the best investors are interested in having their eyes opened by entrepreneurs to problems they didn’t know existed.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. For anything.</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>I ask founders sometimes, \"Why do you want venture capital for this business?\" Most of their answers have more to do with availability and perception than fundamentally understanding the tradeoffs and constraints that come with it. Now, I couldn't always tell you what's a venture-scale business or not. If I could, I'd be the world's best investor because I'd have a historically good picking rate. But I do think that venture is either too hard to get or too easy to get for most people. And there's people for whom it should be easier and a whole bunch of people for whom it should be harder. We're still trying to figure out, you know, are we giving it to the right people?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Okay, so I guess I have two follow-up questions from that. One thing is—the idea around the signaling that matters and how often that can be \"white male ex-Googler,\" ex-blah, blah, blah.</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>Hey, I'm white male ex-Googler!</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Well, you know—</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>And I don't mean, hey, back off, I mean, exactly!</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>What are some ways—that makes it pretty easy, right? What are some ways you've worked around that? When it comes to evaluating people.</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>Well, then I'm proud that all my biases are unconscious. Because I truly don't believe that generically white male founders from Google are the best founders. Now, do I react to skin color, gender, experience set, you know, accent, in ways of which I'm unconscious? Of course I do. And both as an individual and as a partnership, we try to look at cases where that might be a factor in decision-making and understand when and why we're doing that and avoid it or confront it.<br /><br />I think one way we're able to do that at a structural level is to focus probably disproportionately on founder-market fit compared to maybe some of our peers. And what I mean by founder-market fit is, if I had just one conversation with a founder, if I could only have one conversation with a founder, and I had to make a decision about, \"Am I leaning in or out?\" based on one conversation, I would focus on, \"Tell me why. Articulate the problem you're trying to solve, and tell me why that problem matters to you.\" Because, for me, that's the strongest correlation to a founder who has been thinking about something deeply, has a personal connection to it, is likely to stick with it regardless of how hard or easy it is or, for better or for worse, what their investors tell them is right or wrong, and that's ultimately what you want. You want a founder who's a combination of attitude, aptitude, all that, but, you know, who fundamentally believes that this company is what they were put on this earth to do.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>You want a founder who’s a combination of attitude, aptitude, all that, but, you know, who fundamentally believes that this company is what they were put on this earth to do.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>When you do that, what we realize often is that there are founders who sometimes are not within that pattern-matching box that we mentioned and who are not necessarily founders you would back doing anything other than what they're doing right now. So they're not a universal donor blood type. Like, \"Oh, yeah, I'd back you doing a CRM tool, ed tech, or a hardware project.\" No. You're not a generalist. But they are absolutely, without a doubt, a top-one-percent founder for what they're trying to build. So we have a set of those founders... BuildingConnected in the commercial construction real estate space, theSkimm in the media space, Primary in the kids' clothing space... All of those people strike me as examples of founders who are excellent, excellent founders, excellent operators, but are so right for what they're building that there's a set of characteristics that they have, a set of experiences they have, that transcend some of the things you would see on a resume—some of the things you wouldn't see if you just stood them in front of you and asked, \"Did you work at Google? Do you have a CS degree?\" and so on and so forth.<br /><br />Now, there's a whole bunch of other things—privileges or lack thereof—that may have impacted them up to that point, right? But at least in the moment, I am much more interested in somebody who has experience, empathy, deep connection, and insights into the construction industry because they worked in it for a few years, coming to me and telling me that they are going to reinvent it, than I am in two twenty-five-year-old white Stanford engineers who worked at Facebook and are hella smart but are interested in the industry because it's large and because it's \"broken,\" because there's not a lot of white Stanford Facebook engineers who've taken on the problem.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It's interesting how common that is.</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>I just think, if you have contempt for the market you're serving, if you try to disrupt it with contempt or hate as opposed to disrupting with love, it just feels different, and I think in a lot of cases it's an organ transplant that the industry's going to reject.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>That's so interesting. Yeah, that is super common, just talking to people about companies, and they're like, \"Oh, yeah, we're not experienced in it, but we saw this problem, and we're going to fix it from the outside.\"</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>And it's fine! We have an investment in a company called Honor that's in the elder care space.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Oh, my friend's brother works there.</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>Yeah! It's a great team, and we've known Seth for a long time. And he fits a lot of stereotypes in the sense of, like, he's a smart guy, white guy, exited a company at Google, previous founder, you know, all of that type of stuff. But the reason he started this company has to do with a conversation he was having with his parents, confronting what their AARP years were going to look like.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Sure, yeah.</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>Realizing that for the first time and realizing that everything he's done up to this point gave him the ability to address it. The company that he wanted to build to solve this problem needed access to capital and needed to be a twenty-year project, not a two-year project, four-year project, quick flip, whatever. And that all those conditions meant that he could leverage his privilege, right? Bring the team back together with which he worked, raise money right off the bat, and have the trust of the industry, the venture industry, in order to say, \"Hey, this service is going to take a while before it works at scale. But when it works at scale, it's going to be big and important.\"<br /><br />If it was your first company, if you didn't have credibility, you didn't have all these things, it would be hard to start that company. And that company is operating with great values, great ethics, you know, a more diverse team that many we see or in which we've invested. But it was a founder who fit the archetype, in some ways, trading on that to do something bigger. I think of that as pattern-matching judo. As opposed to just being able to raise $5 million for a stupid idea without question, where somebody who wasn't white, male, and known wouldn't be able to get that same $5 million, he was like, \"I'm going to raise $20 million, and I'm going to do something that is really hard.\"</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. That's really cool. Another question I had was—I think you gave a talk about total addressable markets and how that's not an ideal target for founders to pitch to VCs. What do you see as the alternative for that?</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>So my belief is that total addressable market as a slide in a pitch deck is nothing more than a crude intelligence test, in the sense that, if that entrepreneur hasn't figured out a way to say that it's a big market, they've failed. But at the same time, it obfuscates what you should really be thinking, which is, \"What's the problem I'm solving? And is that problem large, urgent, and valuable?\" So TAM, in and of itself, is a backwards-looking statement about where money has been spent based upon the available options.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>Problem size, urgency, and value are indications of how receptive the market is to your solution and whether you can earn money from it, with adoption and value on a timeframe that would be able to prove that it’s a venture-scale business.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Problem size, urgency, and value are indications of how receptive the market is to your solution and whether you can earn money from it, with adoption and value on a timeframe that would be able to prove that it's a venture-scale business. So, if you only have one of those three—if it's large but not urgent or valuable, I don't think you can build a business, venture dollars or not. If you have two of the three, I think you can probably build a business. I'm just not sure it's venture velocity, venture-scale. But if you have all three, that's an interesting value proposition.<br /><br />So, for example, the company BuildingConnected is in the commercial construction space. Construction is a $7 trillion industry. But that would be a ridiculous fact to throw out because that speaks to a whole bunch of materials, labor, things that have nothing to do with what they're building. But then if you go all the way to the other end of the scale, the software space that they were attacking, today, or when they started in 2013, was basically a $100 million market. That's tiny. That's too small for a venture-scale business. So if they had said it was $7 trillion, you'd roll your eyes. If they had said $100 million, you would say, \"This is niche. This is too small.\"<br /><br />But why is their TAM $100 million? Their TAM is $100 million because that represents one percent of the problem. Ninety-nine percent of that is being done through spreadsheet, roll-your-own databases, email. It just so happens that one percent of the problem is being solved by bad, five-to-ten-year-old enterprise software that these guys can kill, as well as get the other ninety-nine percent of the market off of email, off of homegrown databases, off of spreadsheets, into a freemium SaaS product.<br /><br />I think, if you're going to be an early-stage investor, where fundamentally you have to be early or contrarian, if you are chasing after just large TAMs, you're going to be incremental. You're going to be late. And you're going to lose the nuance of saying, \"Okay, what has to happen during the first one to two years to prove that this business exists?\" The classic argument is that SMBs (small and midsize businesses) are a large market in aggregate, large TAM, but, first, they're fragmented, so their needs aren't all the same. You can't just say an accountant is the same as a sandwich shop, but both would be called SMBs. And they're busy. So if what you're trying to pitch them isn't one of the top three things they're trying to solve this year, it's a nice-to-have, not a need-to-have. And no venture-scale business ever grew in the first few years off of trying to bring a nice-to-have to market. And so we really try to ask not just, \"Oh, is this a big market? Is a lot of money being spent?\" but, \"What's the problem you're solving, and why is your solution better than how people are solving this problem today?\"</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Makes sense. Let's see. So, back to starting a company—there was this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blakeir/status/869273958478118913\">discussion</a> that Blake Robbins started a week or two ago, about work culture here and whether it's healthy and whether you can be successful without ascribing to the 24/7/365 mentality. I wanted to know what your take was. I know you shared a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-actually-agree-keith-rabois-sara-mauskopf\">piece</a> that Sara Mauskopf wrote.</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>So I believe that—people sometimes say that it's a marathon, not a sprint, and I think that it's sprints with rests. I respect entrepreneurs and people in general who say, \"I perform at a high level because I don't just work smart, I work hard. But I also understand myself to know when I need things besides work to help me recharge, to help me focus, to help me have a life that will allow me to do this job for one, five, ten years. I know that by choosing to do this startup, I am making some set of sacrifices and tradeoffs.\" That, to me, is different than seeing your only two options as work forty hours a week or work a hundred hours a week.<br /><br />I think it's more dangerous to tell people that you can succeed in tech startups working forty hours a week than it is to warn people that, in order to succeed doing early-stage, mid-stage companies, you are going to have to make some tradeoffs. You are going to have to prioritize it in a way that prevents you from doing other things. That doesn't mean that you don't need a support network, that doesn't mean that you don't need to understand and value self-care, that doesn't mean that you can do it sustainably forever to the sacrifice of everything else in your life. But anything that has been built of consequence required sacrifice and tradeoff from the people who dedicated themselves to it.<br /><br />I went through—and I probably still do at times, but I know I went through when I was on the operating side—extended periods of prioritization of work that were unhealthy for me, both physically and mentally. I probably could've handled it better and performed the same way if I had had access to more mentorship, access to a better understanding and articulation in the moment of what I was feeling, more conversation with my peers about it. So I think I could have had the same performance with better health, but I know that I couldn't have done it, accomplished what I accomplished as part of teams, without prioritizing the work and sacrificing other aspects of my life.<br /><br />So—if that's too nuanced and you're going to put me on a spectrum, I'm going to be more toward the work versus balance. But I don't think it's in a way that we should celebrate divorce, celebrate breakdowns, celebrate suicides, celebrate drug addiction, as the things you have to do in order to really win.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. Well, because I think there is some of that. The glamorizing of health issues, for instance? Like with Sam Altman. There's always this story of how he got scurvy when he was building a company early and only eating ramen. What do you think is behind that specific impulse, I guess?</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>It's romantic and addictive. I internalize that period, even though I know what I did to myself and I know how fundamentally unhappy I was outside of my work accomplishments at several times. I just think back, and I get a little shot of adrenaline when I remember, \"Oh, yeah, you got that done in a way that you left it all on the field, left it all on the table. That was the physical manifestation, the mental manifestation, of what you did.\" And I would never want to go back to that, I'm not proud of it, but there's a dopamine hit that, for me, comes from when I think back to sacrificing everything, getting the physical ailments, the mental ailments. I also have memories of things that were all good, didn't have those tradeoffs, but I'm like, \"Man, I did it.\"<br /><br />So I don't know. I think it's biological in some sense. Fight-or-flight type of shit. And essentially you're in the fight. Just like we take painful experiences and mitigate the way we remember the pain to allow ourselves to do it again as a survival mechanism. I think that's the same type of shit we're talking about. And is the culture, do those stories, end up with collateral damage, unintended consequences? Sure. I don't think it's just—I think it's a physiological thing as much as it is cultural in tech. And that exact thing is probably more horizontal than it is vertical. Exists in every industry to some extent.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Last question, then—I don't know if this one's too broad, and I can ask another one. But what do you see as your primary concerns or what you think can be improved most in VC in general? Current patterns or trends or whatever.</p><p><strong>HUNTER</strong></p><p>VC in general? Yeah. I think what I would just hope for everyone on the venture side is—I think you need a high degree of self-awareness in order to understand what investment model and strategy make sense for you, to which types of founders you're going to be most useful, and never forget that the founders are your customers. It's not your LPs, it's not your managing partners, not the other GPs. Those people may all feel like your customers, but they're your partners, your friends, your colleagues. At the end of the day, you need—while not forgetting that you're an investment manager, so that you can articulate and protect your interests—you have to serve the founder.<br /><br />And so I think you have a lot of people who sometimes try to be all things to all people as opposed to saying, \"Hey, these are the types of risks with which I'm comfortable, these are the types of risks with which I'm not comfortable. Let me take on the risks with which I'm comfortable. For the risks with which I'm not comfortable, I'm going to be a bad partner to that entrepreneur.\"<br /><br />A lot of funds don't address how internal dynamics and politics play into the work and think everything's working fine but have a lot of the internal decisions that end up impacting the entrepreneur in ways that are unintended. I catch myself when I'm working with companies and remember, \"Am I giving this advice because I think it's what the company needs? Am I giving this advice because it benefits me? Am I giving this advice because I don't understand it, but it's something I'm repeating from others?\" And ultimately this founder needs to make a decision, and so I need to empower them and not assume that I have the right answer.<br /><br />I mean, there's a host of things, but I think entrepreneurs would benefit greatly if we (and I fall into these traps as well) said, \"No,\" to investments more often based upon an understanding of whether we can be of use to that entrepreneur rather than whether we think that entrepreneur can make us money. You commit to backing the person, not just the professional. We're about four and a half years into the firm—within our portfolio, we've had marriages and divorces. We've had babies and cancer. We've had all these life events that our founders are experiencing while they're doing this stressful thing, building this company.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>At the end of the day, I want [our founders] to build something that they want on their tombstone, not just their resume or their bank account.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>I always just hope to have the trust with them that we can talk about how things are going holistically and help them navigate everything that would help them bring all of themselves to that business and hold them accountable to building something that makes them proud.

    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <h3>Jacob co-founded Bumpers, a podcasting app. He worked at Medium and Twitter, where he built Bootstrap, a HTML/CSS/JavaScript web development framework.</h3><h3>In our conversation, he talked about getting attached to his robot vacuum, accidentally building the world's most popular front-end framework, and feeling imposter syndrome, even as a senior engineer.</h3>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Okay, so I internet-stalked you, I guess? I read some of your Medium posts and stuff like that, and there was one Medium post that you didn’t write but someone wrote about you while you were working at Medium, and it talked about how you studied or were interested in sociology and critical theory. And I was wondering if you had any thoughts on that in relation to technology.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Yeah. I don’t know if you ever found this, but I have a blog that I used to keep up a long time ago. I haven’t written on it in, like, five years, but it’s <a href=\"http://byfat.xxx/\">byfat.xxx</a>. I wrote on that a number of articles that are more the intersections of more philosophy, sociology, critical theory, and tech and how I approach different ideas and different things I was struggling through at the time. I don’t know—you guide me. Let me know. What kinds of things in particular? It’s a big field.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, yeah. I don’t know—Ted Kaczynski's <em>Unabomber Manifesto</em>, the idea that technology is a dehumanizing force and it controls people more than people can control it. Maybe whether you see validity there, where he gets stuff wrong, I don’t know.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>What are my thoughts on that? Yeah, we can start there, just go deep right away. Let’s see. What are my thoughts on that?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>That’s one thing I found interesting—I feel like I haven’t talked to anyone else who was interested in stuff like that.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>I think that that stuff’s really interesting. So last year I went to TED for the first time, and I thought it was just going to be another lame conference. And I was surprised that there’s really three things that billionaires are absolutely obsessed with. Just people that are so wealthy that they just have time to think about everything. And the three things were recurrent themes throughout the entire TED weekend, which was weird to me.<br /><br />So the first thing was probably, “Are robots or is artificial intelligence going to get too smart and take over?” So that’s one recurring theme. The second one is, “Are we living in virtual reality already?” So you have Elon Musk—people that are taken very seriously who very intensely believe that we are living in a simulacrum. And the third one is, “We need to colonize Mars, and otherwise we’re going to go extinct.” So those are the three things that people were obsessing about, pretty much. Or at least they were last year.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Like, not just Elon Musk and co.? Other people.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>I don’t get super depressed by the alienation of the humanist aspects of technology. I’m like, “Okay, yeah, sure, that might be happening.” But I’m less judgey about it, or I have a tendency to freak out less about it.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>No, no, no, everyone, pretty much, there. So you can think of TED as this really weird intersection of cultural and technological elites that have to spend—just to attend, you have to apply, like you’re going to school or something, and then you get accepted, and you have to give them $10,000, $15,000, just to get a ticket. Which is also absurd. And then it’s just a weird mix-up of scientists, VCs, and crazy people talking about weird shit. But that’s all they care about. Pretty much.<br /><br />So I guess maybe it’s useful to put forth my philosophical disposition, just to contextualize everything. I’m pretty—not quite nihilist, but pretty close to that. So I’m less—I don’t get super depressed by the alienation of the humanist aspects of technology. I’m like, “Okay, yeah, sure, that might be happening.” But I’m less judgey about it, or I have a tendency to freak out less about it. I do find some of those other arguments kind of compelling, and I do think that it’s vaguely interesting. But I’m less—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Other arguments as in the simulation hypothesis?</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Yeah. But again, I’m so out of the school world now. That’s why I was saying, maybe my blog, which is older, would be more inspiring or interesting to you than thirty-year-old me. Just because I haven’t thought about this stuff very much. But yeah.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>But what are your thoughts on those three things, then, that everyone’s obsessed about?</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Yeah. I’ll go in reverse order. So the colonizing Mars thing is stressful to me because space is scary, to me, low-key. I don’t even like flying in airplanes, so getting on a massive rocket ship just sounds insane to me. And the crazy thing is, they don’t talk about it like, “In 150 years, we’re going to colonize Mars,” it’s like, “We need to colonize Mars in ten years,&nbsp;or we’re going to go extinct.” Which is—then you’re like, “Oh my god.” Or like, “Oh, I’m cryogenically freezing myself and my wife because the human race is going extinct if we don’t go to Mars and whatever,” and you’re just like, “Ohhh my god. Alright, for sure.”<br /><br />I think that we mythologize Mars in this weird way. I’m obviously no scientist, but I do think we’re killing Earth in an insane way. But I’m not super stressed about going to Mars. Basically I feel like I’m going down with the Earth, so if the Earth bursts into flames, I, too, will probably be of a similar fate.<br /><br />And then… the “we’re living in a simulation” thing is super interesting to me. And I think it’s Elon Musk and his whole crew—they talk about it all the time. This is one of my favorite stories. I used to work at Medium with Ev Williams and stuff, and he was a billionaire tech nerd, so he’s very much in the scene, and he was at dinner with Barack Obama, Elon Musk, a handful of people who are very important. And Elon Musk was explaining this theory to the table, like, “Yeah, we’re living in a simulation, blah blah blah.” And he was freaking out about it. And Barack Obama is just drinking water the whole time, Ev said, and at the end, he’s like, “All I know is, if I hug a girl, I feel something, and it’s real.”<br /><br />For sure. It’s been a long time, but I remember when was really nerding out on stuff, I’d read Baudrillard and things like that, and I definitely really had to be careful, especially when I was younger. Like, thinking back now, this is my sage advice as an old person—I romanticized a lot of philosophers like that because their writing is so sexy to me.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Baudrillard sometimes doesn’t even really make sense, I feel like.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>No, not at all!</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It sounds really good, I’m on board with it, but I don’t know what it means.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Yeah. I’m just like, “I want to believe,” because it sounds so dope. But I definitely catch what he’s saying on things, and then again maybe this is the nihilist aspect of me—if we are hypothetically living in a simulation or everything has become this weird copy of a copy that’s so perverted that we are no longer interacting with the real things—that’s fine. I’m fine with that.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, that makes it easy. And I guess same with AI?</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Yeah. Well, AI. I guess the third one would be, “Are robots going to take over?” or whatever. That one’s interesting to me. So I have this thing called a Eufy—do you know what that is? It’s like a little Roomba-type thing. And I have Alexa and a bunch of these things, which I can only assume are the absolute dumbest versions of the actual technology that's out there because they're consumer products, so the cheapest, dumbest versions, but—even then, it's kind of insane how easy it is to project some sort of personality onto robots already.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>The eventual evolution of the technology and integration of that technology at some level is going to put that hierarchy of human-robot into question in a really profound way.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Like, this little Roomba thing—it'll get stuck on my rug all the time, and I'll be like, \"Aw, Eufy, get off of my rug! I'll save you, Eufy.\" And just even that interaction makes me think that the eventual evolution of the technology and integration of that technology at some level is going to put that hierarchy of human-robot into question, I think, in a really profound way. I don't know if I'll see it in my lifetime, but I definitely feel like I would come down on the side of robot sympathizers. I feel the struggle of being the robot, so—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Just let them take over.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Yeah. Also, I feel like everyone's designed them so cute that you can't help but have this real love for them. I don't know. I also think it's interesting that a handful of my friends have Alexa, Amazon Alexa, and you can call it Amazon or you can say, \"I want to use Alexa,\" as the key name. Every single person I know uses Alexa. I've never heard anyone say, \"Amazon, what's the weather today?\"</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, that's true.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>And I think it's because people want to humanize robots in that way. The thing that I'm less certain of is the apocalyptic \"robots will become so smart they attack and eliminate the human race.\" Although that's possible—I just don't see the angle, per se. So I don't know. I'm hyped for that. So, for example, I have allergies. But if I could have a robot cat, I'm down. I'm ready to have that. So I wouldn't be super excited if my robot cat tried to attack me, but I'd hopefully foster some good relationships, I don't know.<br /><br />So what sort of other things are you reading? You said that you were reading the Unabomber thing. What Heidegger are you reading?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p><em>The Question Concerning Technology</em>. I don't know how I feel about that. About Heidegger in general, actually.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Yeah, he's kind of a weird dude.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Anyway, another thing I was wondering about—you say a lot that you hate coding and computers, but, I don't know, not to state the obvious, but you do that.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>How does that connect?</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Yeah, good question. I think there's a couple ways to answer that. One way is I like the end product of computers often. And it just so happens that you have to code and slave away on this stupid computer to get to the end result. I like communicating with people, and I like writing things and creating art and doing other things. And I think that the computer and internet, etc., can make a lot of those things a lot better.<br /><br />This is going to be a real Kanye, pompous, godlike comparison, but if you think of some Greek sculpture person or something, was he super into carving away at stone? Was that his favorite [thing to do]? That sounds also pretty fucking terrible. Just chipping away at stone all day. Like, it's dusty and messy and hard. He probably fucked his fingers up. It sounds like basically the shittiest thing ever. But then at the end, you're like, \"Holy shit, this looks tight, I'm glad I suffered through this whole thing.\" So there's that aspect of it.<br /><br />And then there's also the aspect where I feel like there's a handful of things I really love that I constantly hold against technology and virtual things. So I really like zine culture, for example. And a lot of that is just—even if it's just the shittiest little photocopied thing, just that tangibility and the limited physical nature of it, I think, is really cool and valuable, and it takes on its own kind of form of coolness. Just because it's like, \"Oh, wow, ten of these little booklets were made, and some person put this stuff together, or maybe they drew something specific into it, and it's the only one like this.\" And I feel like a lot of technology is spent trying to reproduce that and ultimately failing. Almost everything on the internet that I've worked on has been directly trying to attack an analog version of the same thing.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Sure.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>And after a while, maybe it's better, but I feel like in trying to copy the thing that it's replacing, it's always doing a disservice to the original thing. Like, there'll never be a Medium article that's as engaging and as beautifully laid out as a magazine article—a good magazine article. So I don't know, so that can kind of bum me out. Feeling like you're a part of the device which is systematically taking out the things you really like.<br /><br />So that's the one side, which is real. And then the other side is—the thing that attracted me to computers when I was ten, when computers were not cool, not sexy—there were no apps. At all. It was just lame as shit, and I was on my Compaq Presario, just like, \"Ding ding ding ding\"—was how lame they were.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Wait, the thing that attracted you?</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Yeah. It was just how dorky they were. I loved how there was the mythos of the computer having nerdy people use it, and it's this tool that's ugly and weird, but it was at the same time really fun. Every once in a while, I stumble into a little microcommunity—the latest one, for example, is mechanical keyboards, which I feel like still capture this. It's a really small community that's obsessed with mechanical keyboards, which are pretty much obsolete, more or less, and just the dorkiest, clacky [objects]—and people obsess, they build them from scratch, they solder their motherboard things or computer boards together, they get custom-braided cables. It cannot be a dorkier pasttime. But I am so here for it? I'm so into it.<br /><br />And I feel like computers, being into computers, at one point, was that, kind of. It was another kind of cool, weird thing that you could be into that you could identify with, and at some point, computers became so absolutely mainstream and a part of everyday life to such a point that people forgot the culture of them being weird and dorky and random, which are the things when I was younger that got me so stoked on them. So part of me hating computers and saying that I hate computers and constantly being like, \"This shit is for losers,\" is me trying to—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Make it true?</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Remind people that that's what computers are for. They're for nerds. So don't get it twisted. This is not—y'all tried to take this from the nerds, but it's still a nerdy-ass device. There's still Terminal on your Mac. There's still all these little pockets of Unix stuff hidden away. And it's just really easy to forget it when it's like, \"Oh, yeah, I go on Twitter, or I go on my computer to check Instagram and use Word,\" or something, I don't know.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. I don't know if you've read Jaron Lanier's—he wrote this book called <em>You Are Not a Gadget</em>, and he talks about the death of Web 1.0 culture, I guess. Like, weird websites that are kind of ugly and use ugly bright colors and things like that—and how it moved to the more mass-produced Facebook profiles, Twitter profiles, whatever, look.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>I haven't read that—it sounds interesting. It's definitely true. I was very much a part of the Web 2.0 wave, which is horrible, which was a horrible wave of gradients, and—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>And Bootstrap, I guess, is—I mean, I used Bootstrap, so obviously there's lots of good things about it. But there's also definitely that kind of uniformity of style?</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Oh, yeah, it's like the complete and total homogenization of the web, yeah. It cannot be seen as more destructive. But it's weird—if you think about Bootstrap, for example. I'm someone who really wants there to be radical, unique, different destinations and experiences, especially on the internet. And it's like, \"Oh, Bootstrap is the opposite of that.\" But if you think of Bootstrap—Bootstrap was just crazy. It's really like if you were—I'm trying to think of a good example.<br /><br />It would be kind of like if you were going to make a sandwich for yourself, and you're like, \"This sandwich is pretty good, but I'm going to make a sauce to put on my sandwich.\" And then you did that. And then someone across the room saw that sauce, and they were like, \"That looks kind of good.\" And you were like, \"Okay, like, you know, y'all can use my sauce, too, that's cool.\" And then, on the other side of the whole restaurant, some mass-producer person was like, \"We should take this sauce and bottle it and sell it. People are going to fucking love this sauce.\" And then you're like, \"Okay. For sure. People might find it useful, maybe. Maybe someone will come by and need some extra sauce.\"<br /><br />And then all of a sudden, 10% of sandwiches in the world have your sauce on it, and you're like, \"Oh my god. I just tried to make, like, a simple sandwich for myself. I can't believe 10% of all sandwiches have my sauce on it.\" And then you're like, \"Oh my god, did I just, like, make the web—or did I just make all sandwiches taste like my sandwich?\"</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>All of a sudden, 10% of sandwiches in the world have your sauce on it, and you’re like, “Oh my god.

I want some variety, some spice in my life. But that's kind of the sandwich version of what happened. Which is to say, it kind of just accidentally happened. And I think we tried to live in denial, a little bit, in two ways. In one way, we were like, \"This will be good because we'll raise the lowest common denominator bar, which is already kind of generic.\" And two, \"We'll try to build in some sort of customizability.\" And also learning—so a lot of people learn how to code by using Bootstrap. And I think that that was true to some extent, but I don't know. It's a hard one. It definitely took on a life of its own, that's for sure.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Like, do you feel like the kind of homogenization or whatever—there's sort of no going back from that, or...?</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Well, I think that the curious thing about the web is—I would even argue the web has pretty much always been a matter—like most design, actually, graphic design—it's a very commercialized process. We just have more people in the field trying to flex in it now. But even if you look—I could show you three websites, and I'm pretty sure you'd be able to say what era they're from. Like, if you go to <a href=\"https://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm\">spacejam.com</a>, you know that that website was built in the 90s and has not been changed. Like, it has flashing animated GIFs and a tile space background. It looks fucking terrible. But also it was very much of its time, and that's just how people were building websites. And it's just because that's, one, the maximum the browsers would really allow you to lay anything out, and, two, I think it was just people—like Instagram and Facebook are doing now—they see stuff that they like and they're like, \"How [can I do that?]\"<br /><br />You either purposefully copy something or you accidentally copy something by trying to, you know, bring in some added flavor or whatever. So I don't know. I think that Bootstrap definitely had its moment, and there was a period of Bootstrap-ization of the web, for sure, but I would say now that the web looks largely the same, too. There might be more subcategories, like, \"This is what a social media website looks like,\" and \"This is what a news website looks like,\" and \"This is what whatever looks like,\" but there's still very much design metaphors that are just used every single time.<br /><br />And they pretty much teach you now, in the design industry—if you're building something that isn't integral to your app, don't innovate on it. So, for example, if you're building—I work on this thing Bumpers, which is a podcasting app. If I build a commenting section, I shouldn't be innovating on comments. I should just look at Instagram and copy exactly—or look at Facebook and copy exactly how comments are done... because it's working, and it's fine. It's fucking comments. No one cares. I think maybe there's some ideal world where Bootstrap provided those design metaphors and allowed for more innovation by eliminating the time you needed to spend reinventing certain wheels, but I don't know whether or not that's true.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Okay, so, maybe related—I read your blog post about rewriting Bumpers in React. And—this is less related to that and more related to React in general—what about the convergence of how people build things? Because I feel like, at this point—and this is also more of a JavaScript thing—there are \"right\" frameworks and other frameworks that are inferior and you should never use them?</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>Yeah, that's weird. I think that the thing that happened is—especially today, more so than ever—it's interesting. So I listen to a lot of hip-hop, and for a long time everyone wanted to be taken seriously as a rapper and the best lyricist. And then everyone wanted to be taken seriously as the best artist—they no longer wanted to be seen as just a rapper. And now you see—Lil Yachty and stuff like that—where they don't want to be artists, they don't want to be rappers, they want to be brands. They want to be like Jay Z, where you just say their name and there's all these connotations you have of them. Which is, one, insane, but two, but also maybe smart and useful.<br /><br />But I think that we live in this crazy time where everything is so extremely branded. Like, Bootstrap's Twitter thing probably has a hundred thousand followers or something. And it's very much a brand that's completely separate from what the code is or what it tries to do that people just conjure up when you say, \"Oh, this is Bootstrap,\" or \"I built this on Bootstrap.\" It's like, \"Oh, are you a noob?\" or \"Do you not know stuff very well?\"<br /><br />Or, \"Oh, I built this on React,\" \"Oh, wow, that's the new hot thing, blah blah blah. Oh, Facebook engineers built that? Wow! Ooh!\" Or, \"Oh, I built this on PHP,\" \"Oh, are you a scrub? PHP is outdated... why would you use PHP?\" When in reality, it's like—Facebook's written on PHP, and behind the scenes, there's all this crazy overlap of everything, and then people fetishize brands so much.<br /><br />I think it's in some ways because people demand—well, I don't know if it's the immediacy of moving forward and moving at this breakneck pace all the time, but most people don't spend the time—rightfully because there's so many choices—saying, \"Okay, I'm going to start an app from scratch. Which language should I use? Should I use Go, should I use Rust?\" Those are some hot new ones. \"Should I use Rails or Python?\" Which have more been around. \"Or Java? Should I use PHP? Or Node?\" Something that's easier and you can move faster with.<br /><br />And there's all these other things that start popping up, like hiring people—what are people going to want to work on, and why are they going to want to work on that? It's insane. And that's just with back-end technology. And then there's front-end technology and libraries and a bunch of stuff compounded onto that. It's really bizarre.<br /><br />And so I think it's a lot to do with brands. You could argue to some extent, once a brand gets big enough, the community comes into play. I think Rails was actually the first one to really nail community. Maybe PHP was and I just missed that wave, but Rails was the first community for me. Well, it was the first community that, at the time, Ruby just felt really hot. It was a really hot language. So some dude in Japan wrote it, and everyone was like, \"Wow, that's sick,\" and, \"Oh, it's really pretty, and you can do all these crazy little shortcuts for things.\" At the time. Everyone was just like, \"Oh my god, Ruby's the best language.\"<br /><br />And so you saw Twitter written in Ruby and a bunch of new startups at the time were originally written in Ruby. And the community grew so strong that after a while, you could just be like, \"I need to build authentication flows,\" and just do `gem install authentication`. And, \"Oh, I need to build an image uploader\"—`gem install image-uploader`. Stuff like that.<br /><br />I think React is pretty much at the same place now. Bootstrap was like that at one point, where you can find Bootstrap plugins for most UI things at this point. And React definitely—the plugins are usually terrible, but you can use them in a pinch or at least get inspiration from them. So yeah. I don't know. React is an interesting one, though, because it's so terrible for building 99% of projects. But it really reaffirms in the most hilarious way to me the power of branding. That so much is built on it when it's the absolute worst decision you could possibly make 90% of the time. That's kind of wild.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>[React] really reaffirms in the most hilarious way to me the power of branding.

I'm Team Not Everyone Should Be, but I do think more people should be than are, if that makes sense? So I hate math, for example. I suck at math. I got to the math portion of the SAT and I was just like, pencil down. I was like, \"I'm going to fail this shit.\" I'm so bad at math. And I'm just not interested. They're like, \"Oh, do this math problem,\" and I'm like, \"Not trying to figure out the square... I don't got time for that. Tell me to do anything else.\" Yeah. Coding, I feel like, is the same way.<br /><br />I think that at times, society gets too behind certain industries and tries to force that industry into people. So if you think about schools, a lot of critical school theory, education theory, is that everything is set up in such a way to pump out factory workers. And then that industry is all of a sudden not that big in the US, but we're still using the same antiquated system to call and develop to make people work really good in factories. And so I get nervous when people are like, \"Oh, yeah, we should be teaching kids to code because that's the future, there'll be all these jobs, blah blah blah.\" I'm like, \"Eh.\" I don't really know what we should do, but I think that putting all your eggs in one basket like that is a little questionable. And I don't know. I still hope that coding becomes obsolete.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Sure, yeah.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>In some way? Coding, oftentimes, is like sudoku or whatever shit that was. Or like a crossword. It's, like, cool, once in a while, and you're like, \"Oh, that's a fun problem.\" But it's definitely not like, \"Oh, it's Friday night! I'm trying to get turned up and code some shit!\" It's not fun, for most people. Sometimes, some rare people find it tight, and I think that's awesome. But for most people—or at least, for me—it's a means. So I don't know. I would be bummed if, in elementary school, I was forced. One, it would make it a lot less fun, and, two, some people just aren't meant to—I think genetically, your brain works better on some types of problems. I just think coding isn't that way.<br /><br />That said, I do think that there's certain—there's a big debate, which is \"Should designers code?,\" for example, or \"Should product managers code?,\" or other people that are closer into the industry. I also don't think that they should code, or I don't think they should be forced to code, but if you are a product manager or you're a designer, your life is a hundred times easier if you code. And the result of everything you do is better. I just don't like forcing people to do shit, basically. That's my short answer.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Fair enough.</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>I just get stressed out by it.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>The last thing I wanted to ask you about was imposter syndrome, I guess? I don't feel like you call it that, but you know, you talked about how you were hired for a job that you were not qualified for, and then in the React writeup, you were talking about going between crippling self-doubt and Kanye god complex. Why do you think that's so prevalent—I feel like it's prevalent particularly in engineering and tech?</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>I think interviewing is impossible. I just don’t believe it’s possible. I almost think that it should be closer to a raffle system, where literally anyone can apply, and you just get a number, and we randomly draw one.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>It's funny because it's such a common conversation to have with pretty much everyone. There's a certain Friday, you'll be stuck in the office with someone, you'll be having a few beers, you'll be working on something you hate, or you'll have interviewed some candidate that day. Well, I think there's a couple things. One, I think interviewing is impossible. I just don't believe it's possible. I almost think that it should be closer to a raffle system, where literally anyone can apply, and you just get a number, and we randomly draw one. It might actually be more effective than trying to talk to someone for an hour and figure out if they're super intelligent and will make your company grow or something. It's fucking impossible. It's really both a waste of time because it's impossible and it reminds me—yeah, this is what it is.</p><p>I've never made this correlation before, but there's this other thing I fucking hate, when you're at a restaurant and you're having a nice dinner with someone, and you're like, \"I think we should get some wine,\" and the waiter comes over, and they pour this much wine, and they're like, \"Sip this,\" and you're like, \"Okay!\" You try to smell it, you taste it—every single time, everyone's like, \"Yeah, I think it's fine... Pour me that glass.\"</p><p>Because it's just this weird, awkward performance that people have just been doing for so long, but at some point it stopped meaning really anything other than, like, it's just this expectation that they're going to do it, and there's this expectation that you're going to be like, \"It's great. I love it.\" You have to be so incredibly adept and skilled at interviewing to be able to suss out if someone is good in an hour conversation.<br /><br />And no one is good at interviewing because literally what happens is that you get hired at Facebook and next week they're like, \"You have three interviews this week, they're scheduled here, here, and here,\" and you're like, \"Okay.\" And then you show up, and the only thing you can rely on is the different biases you have and you could be having [a bad day]—you could have been dumped the night before, you could have had all this bad shit happen, your PR (your pull request thing to get your code merged) could have been rejected. A bunch of bad day shit can be happening. And you just show up and be an asshole.<br /><br />I've admittedly been like that, where you just can't help it, you're just in a bad mood.&nbsp;<em>Or</em>&nbsp;you show up and you're in the best mood ever. Like, you just had a hot date, or you had the best breakfast ever. You get oatmeal, and you're like, \"I fucking love oatmeal.\" And you have an interview right after, and you're just like, \"I don't even care what you say! You're getting a pass because I'm in the best mood ever. Can I help you through this?\" And I feel like because of the impossibility of interviews, the absolute unknownness of it, and how the more interviewing you do, the more abundantly clear that interviewing is just this weird performance that means nothing and is impossible to get any value out of—you become more and more confused how you got in. The imposter system grows with each interview, where you see the interview panel of what other peers are asking and how they're judging people, and you're like, \"How did I ever get through? I can't answer any of these questions.\"<br /><br />I was mentoring this kid J, and he's doing Code2040, which is this really cool program, and he got an interview at Dropbox, and he's like, \"Hey, I'm going to come over and work on this interview. I have an hour to do this coding problem.\" It was me, my friend Dave, who's another engineer, and we were hanging out playing video games or something. And I was like, \"Yeah, dude, come over if you get stuck, ask a question, it's cool, whatever.\" It's just the take-home test, not anything serious.<br /><br />He got here, and he read through the question, and he's like, \"Fuck, I don't understand this at all.\" I was like, \"What are you talking about, man?\" He's at SF State. He's a fine engineer—young, but fine. And so I read it, and I was like, \"What the fuck?\" Literally the three of us huddled around this computer—and I've been coding for, like, ten years, no big deal. I consider myself also to be on the pretty senior side, and we stressed through this fucking code exam.<br /><br />It was not even to get an internship. It was to get a phone screen to get considered to get interviewed to get an internship at Dropbox. Which is bullshit. Also, Dropbox sends me recruitment emails all the time, like, \"Please consider working at Dropbox, we'd love to have you, Jacob, blah blah blah.\" So the three of us huddled around, tried to write something, finally get something that's pretty much working, and it has an hour—a sixty-minute cutoff and then the page just goes white, like, \"Thank you for working on this problem.\"<br /><br />Anyway, so we got <em>rejected</em>. And it was like—we completely cheated, and we were all competent engineers who had worked at Twitter—my friend Dave literally worked at Dropbox as a contractor for a while, but he worked at Medium and other places. Anyway, we all got shot down. As a crew. And I was just like, \"What the fuck?\" I don't <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fat/status/804398950014849024\">Twitter rant</a> very much because I feel like Twitter gets pretty rant-y, but I was just so shook. And it just completely reaffirmed that absurdity of—like, at this same company where I can't get an internship, I, tomorrow, could become an engineering manager. Which is this weird paradox.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>It just completely reaffirmed that absurdity of—like, at this same company where I can’t get an internship, I, tomorrow, could become an engineering manager. Which is this weird paradox.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>And because of that, I feel like—if you don't have imposter syndrome and you work at a company, I don't trust you. Like, if you think you deserve to be here, you don't get it. You haven't figured out that it's just luck. It's just weird luck and bias and it's crazy. It's weird. So yeah. That's how I feel about it, anyway. And I think that's how a lot of people that are pretty in touch with what's going on and reflected on it at all [feel]. Like, really great engineers feel that way. \"Oh, I just so happened to catch it on the right day when I just so happened to study some algorithm that they happened to ask, and thank god because otherwise...\" And it's always these absurd questions or absurd reasons—like, \"Oh, yeah, I'd love to get a beer with that guy.\" And you're just like, \"Alright.\" So yeah.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, it's funny that you say that because the startup where I worked last year—we would have onsite interviews with five questions, whatever, and at some point our CTO was like, \"You know, I don't think I would pass our interview.\"</p><p><strong>JACOB</strong></p><p>It's impossible. And every time—this is another thing—as you add people that can pass the bar, they raise the bar every single time, higher and higher, until you're just like, \"No one—we can hire no one now. It's just impossible.\" And you just lose touch with your culture. I don't know, it's weird. I don't like hiring. That's why I like small teams of three people, no more. Too problematic.</p>\n</div>"

I was thinking about technology and how it's getting increasingly complex and more abstracted. I think you've talked a little bit about this, but there's this mentality that's a bad thing and making technology more accessible is a bad thing and you're not legit unless you're writing C or working on compilers.</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span> I think that when we struggle with learning and we get to the point where we’re an expert—close to that point—we forget what it was like when we first started.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Yeah, not a “real developer.” I mean, I feel like everyone in the tech community is always on the offense about if they're doing the right thing. Everyone will always talk about how they have imposter syndrome but then in the same breath they're saying, \"If you're not using this tool the way I am, you're not doing it the right way.\" It's a very interesting and frustrating and exhausting thing to witness. So I—and those on the team at Glitch—we want to create a space where people can experiment but also build real web applications.<br /><br />I've been having a lot of conversations online with people about, \"What are you struggling with learning?\" And I'm finding that I'm getting responses from beginners but also expert developers who built the libraries that everyone's fighting over. And it's really interesting to see. There are the engineers who built things like React and Ember, and they say, like, \"Oh, React's cool in this way, Ember's cool in this way,\" and then you have the beginners who are like, \"I don't know which one to use.\" Then there are the people who are in between who aren't necessarily beginners but they're not the experts, and they're the ones that are like, \"Use this because this sucks,\" a lot. And it's a sociological problem that I can't solve; I'm just a witness to it. Like, who hurt you? Why are you like that?<br /><br />And I think that when we struggle with learning and we get to the point where we're an expert—close to that point—we forget what it was like when we first started.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It's really hard to retain!</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Yeah, it happens so fast! And we pull the ladder up behind us, and that makes us jerks, I guess. It's hard to combat that, especially when you want to fit in—we all actually just want to fit in with each other in some sort of way but also be unique at the same time. So that's another stressful component of adulthood that I personally have noticed.<br /><br />So how do we be seen as good at our job while also doing some emotional labor in order to make sure that the people who look up to us or could look up to us have an easier path than we did? I saw this a lot when I was in university, where my professors, especially the women professors, were very tough on me. And I saw that they were trying to groom me to have a thicker skin and stuff, and in retrospect it's like, \"Oh, I appreciate that you were that tough on me because things were tough for you, but wouldn't it be great to break that cycle? And how do we do that?\"</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>How do we be seen as good at our job while also doing some emotional labor in order to make sure that the people who look up to us or could look up to us have an easier path than we did?<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>So I try to go into this role that I'm in now with an open mind and a focus on being more receptive toward the beginners or the people who could potentially be in the industry and not so much on the experts. And in doing that, I do give up a part of myself—one, people not knowing that I'm good at engineering. I do a lot of more social things now. I still write code, but \"Community Engineer\" is my title. And so people then—I get people who now think that, \"Oh, you're not an engineer anymore.\" And it's like—one, that's an incorrect observation. Two, why are you making that observation? Like, what is your goal, to put yourself ahead? You know what I mean? It's just a really interesting—and again, frustrating—thing to witness.<br /><br />But that is just one of the many social problems in the web development community as a whole. Besides the whole cult of personality, where you have those of us with tons of followers on Twitter and are seen as famous—which, ugh, gross whenever I think of that—so then there's this expectation that you have to hold, of being good at everything. And then when you're a woman, you also have to be even better. The men that have the following that I do not have nearly as many issues with harassment, of course. And they're surprised to hear about it.<br /><br />So, for example, my DMs are open on Twitter. And I do that because I organize a couple of meetups and I want to promote people who want to speak, and maybe some of them have never spoken before, and I'll tell them, \"Oh, if you want to speak, DM your ideas and we'll work it out.\" And I don't follow everybody, so I keep my DMs open so that they can contact me there. And it's easier for me to get to and have a conversation through DM than a whole bunch of—like, emails.<br /><br />And so because of that, I will get random people I don't know or I haven't met who will DM me. They'll be argumentative with me. I've received dick pics. I feel like there are accounts on Twitter that have—I don't know if they have bots or scripts or something like that, but they're not people in tech. Well, sometimes they're people in tech. But I feel like they just try to send as many DMs to women as possible, and they get through to mine because my DMs are open.<br /><br />And so I explained to a friend of mine who's an engineer at Mozilla, and he was like, \"Oh, my DMs are open, and I have these great conversations.\" And I was like, \"How many dick pics have you received?\" And he was like, \"Wait, whaaat?\" And I was like, \"Oh, I was just curious if this is just a thing that happens to women, because I think it's bots that do it, and I get them every other week.\" And he's just like, \"No. Jesus, I would close my DMs.\" And I was like, \"Yeah, I would love to not have to deal with that, but then I close off communication to these other people, and if I close off communication, that's seen as cold.\" And so it's navigating these social problems as a woman—a lot more difficult, I would imagine, than it is for my male counterparts.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Do you think that's—I mean, obviously this is partly a societal problem and software can't fix that completely—but I feel like it's also potentially a structural design issue with Twitter, for instance? It's much easier to get into weirdly combative situations with total strangers than it is on basically any other platform.</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Yeah, yeah. I do think it's a design issue of tech. In the tech industry, you have these guys in power who wax poetic about how tech is going to save everybody, but then when they fail, they're like, \"Oh, well, you don't care about—\" Like, with Uber, when that whole scandal was going on. People were pointing out, \"Oh, people on Wall Street are sexist, and no one gets on them.\" And I was like, \"That's because we don't expect Wall Street to give a shit about people. That's their history. We're not going to change them.\"<br /><br />But tech, they go on stage and they talk about how we're going to save the world. And it's like, \"Well, you want to save the world, we have higher expectations of you.\"<br /><br />And it's interesting with Twitter—I love Twitter. I mean, I wouldn't be where I am without Twitter, just the people that I know, the interactions I have, all the opportunities I've gained that I never would have been able to have just being a woman going to meetups and stuff like that, just wouldn't be a thing. And then of course I have to deal with a lot of that bullshit to get to it, but for me, in the end, it’s worth it.<br /><br />I’m seeing a lot of people now who are using <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/about\">Mastodon</a>, the decentralized thing, and I’m on an instance that my friend who’s an engineer at Microsoft made. But everyone’s just like, “Everyone, join Mastodon! Twitter’s full of Nazis. Mastodon is new and great.” And I’m thinking, I’m kind of skeptical, because Mastodon is not going to be great just because it’s a clean slate—you know what I mean? I went on, and I saw an avatar of Pepe. Like, I thought there were no Nazis on here! You know what I mean?<br /><br />Kind of like when Facebook was shutting down accounts of trans women who were not using their dead names. <a href=\"https://ello.co/\">Ello</a> came out, and everyone was like, “Ello is better than Facebook! They won’t delete your names.” Well, Ello’s a completely different kind of platform. It’s made by just another company. It’s new. Who’s to say—just because Ello’s like, “Oh, we’re not going to put ads on our site”—who’s to say that they’re not going to change their—you know.<br /><br />There’s just a lot of… I’m just very surprised that people—even my age and younger—have these expectations that they hold on these tech companies, and then they’re so shocked when they’re let down. I’m like, “I guess I’m just super jaded.” I assume that everything I put online that is under the guise of a private site is going to be made public at some point. It’s going to be sold to somebody. It’s going to get hacked and stuff like that. And there’s not going to be really a way for me as an individual to hold those people accountable.<br /><br />I don’t know. Every time I blame stuff on capitalism, I have to send my friend Potch a dollar. So not going to go into that point, but, you know, it’s definitely—it’s very interesting. Another thing that I think of is when I was working at the university, every fall, when the new students would come through, I’d see groups of them out smoking cigarettes, and I’m like, “When’s the year that, like, college kids are going to be hip to not smoking cigarettes?” But I just don’t see it happening, and so you just—the kids keep coming through and using the internet and they witness all of the news and scandals around sexism in tech and people being hacked and people selling stuff, but they just choose to be oblivious to that, and then there’s this sort of performative outrage whenever bad things happen, which then does fade. Performative outrage has an expiration date, and that’s why companies are able to get away with all these things.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It feels like even now—the United thing happened yesterday. Now people are like, “Wow, shift in narrative, man had whatever drug-related history!”</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Yeah, like that! And Pepsi was last week, and so now everyone’s like, “Wow, Pepsi must be happy because of the United thing.” Yeah.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It just feels like a very weird—and I don’t know if it’s accurate or not because my perception of this is probably very skewed—but it just feels like the way that we experience events now is getting more and more condensed. And I don’t know what sort of implications that that has.</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Yeah. And also, a couple people at lunch were like, “Oh, what’s the Pepsi thing?” So, you know, we’re all in this social bubble where I’m on Twitter all the time, and so I know about all these different things. But then I have all these friends who only use Facebook, and they’re like, “Oh, I know this thing,” and of course on Facebook the news is a lot more superficial. Some of this is like, “Oh, this celebrity was out and about,” and I’m like, “I don’t even know who that is! Twitter?” So it’s—besides navigating the social issues within the web development community, also dealing with current events and navigating how to handle that and the post-election thing. It’s just a lot of complicated things happening online.<br /><br />And then I spoke at NYU a couple of weeks ago. There was a woman there who was an engineering student, and she was like, “I don’t use social media. How do I find meetups to go to?” I think she was interested in music theory and tech. And, you know, normally my advice for people is, “Oh, you could check social media or whatever,” but she was like, “No, I don’t do that.” You know what I mean? So you remember that there’s a whole other contingent of people out there that navigate society in a completely different way than I do, and all I can do is be like, “Don’t understand that world, so I can try to find somebody else, but my road to finding things is social media, and I don’t know how to do it otherwise.”</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Do you experience—I mean, apart from, obviously, harassment and abuse and stuff—negative effects from social media just from social media operating as it should? For me, I feel like I love Twitter, but I feel like very often I will reach a sort of different state of mind or something using it, and it feels not good for me when I get too sucked in. You don’t have to feel that way!</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>When there are—whenever there are little pockets of drama, like within the JavaScript community or something like, or something really infuriating happens, I’ll be like, “What’s going on?” And I’ll be seeing the responses to it, and it sort of snowballs into, “Oh, this is a really big systemic problem that I can’t fix with a tweetstorm.” Or if it doesn’t involve me but it still angers me, I feel like, “I need to process this away from the screen and have conversations with my friends and people I know and not involve the internet in that.” It’s very hard to get lost in all of that content and discussion. One of my arguments against using just Mastodon and leaving Twitter is that I’ve been using Twitter for nine years. I’ve curated who I follow and what I’m looking at, and I know all those people aren’t going to just move over to Mastodon, so why would I leave my regular reading content? Because something else is apparently better. Which, from what I can tell, isn’t exactly true, so yeah.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Okay, so switching topics. Another thing I wanted to ask you about was—I watched your <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wewAC5X_CZ8\">XOXO talk</a>, and you made fun of Peter Thiel and the blood of the young or whatever—</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Parabiosis?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah! That seems to be not just Peter Thiel, you know? It seems to be a thing in tech for people to want to live longer and avoid the apocalypse—</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Avoid eating regular food via Soylent. Yeah.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>And I guess I’m curious about what your thoughts are on a broader level about that, what that says about tech and society and whatever.</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>So Soylent is the first thing that comes to mind. And I have friends who try it and some who are like, “I’m going to drink Soylent,” and I’m very skeptical of it. I’m very skeptical of most things that come out of tech culture.<br /><br />I grew up very poor. I was homeless in the last year of—last half of my senior year of high school. And I’m doing great now. And I’m always trying to be aware of how I can use where I’m at now to help people who were in my position. So volunteering with young girls at underserved schools and our meetups—<a href=\"http://brooklynjs.com/\">Brooklyn.js</a> and all the other Manhattan.js meetups—we donate all the proceeds of sales after expenses to <a href=\"https://scripted.org/\">ScriptEd</a> so we can provide computer science education to underserved schools.<br /><br />So then I see other people that claim that they’re community leaders and stuff—or just—I don’t know, they don’t say they’re community leaders. Like, the guy who created Soylent’s not a community leader, but he definitely sees himself as somebody who’s innovating the human experience. And I feel like the human experience needs to be innovated for everybody and not just rich white men in tech.<br /><br />So when I first about Soylent, I think I was in grad school—it was a long time ago. It was like, “Oh, it’s this superfood, it’s easy to access, blah blah blah.” I assumed, reading about it—maybe it was an essay he wrote or something like that—I assumed that it was supposed to be solving world hunger.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>I feel like the human experience needs to be innovated for everybody and not just rich white men in tech.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>I think especially initially they did <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/12/13/health/soylent-hunger/index.html\">frame it that way</a>.</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Yeah! I was like, “Am I crazy or was this the thing that was supposed to be solving world hunger?” But nobody poor is eating it, which means that nobody poor has access to it. It’s packaged in really nice bottles and I always see tech people experimenting, trying it out, or the guy who founded it talking about solely eating that. So it’s like, “Well, if you’re such an innovator of the human experience, why aren’t you using that to help people who actually need that?” I don’t think that engineers need to be more productive. I don’t see it as a high-priority issue to me.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>I mean, especially in terms of—it feels like a very sort of tech thing to say, “I don’t even have time to eat for half an hour a proper meal.” How much is that really gaining?</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Right, yeah. And I mean, this also goes completely against the part of culture of tech that I am in where work-life balance is really important. It’s a slippery slope—I feel like if you’re like, “Oh, eating takes up too much time.” Well, then, how many steps from “Eating a normal meal is unproductive” to “Getting pregnant is too unproductive, and how do we prevent pregnancy from being an unproductive part of the workplace? Well, we could just get rid of anybody who has the ability to get pregnant…” which is what academia does.<br /><br />So, you know what I mean? I see these things where people are trying to make engineers more productive, and it’s like, “You are basically creating a space to potentially block out marginalized people from being part of your world.”</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Well, because then the most productive person is just the young white male with no attachments and no family and stuff.</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Yeah, exactly. And by the time they get burned out, it’s too late for them to find a healthy relationship to move on. And then what are they going to do after that? So it’s a lot of—it’s just very selfish thinking.<br /><br />And you know, the guy who made Soylent wrote <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/08/op-ed-how-i-gave-up-alternating-current/\">this blog post</a> about other things that he does in order to enhance his life as a very productive person, and one of them was that he doesn’t do laundry. He was like, “Oh, I save energy and water by not washing clothes. Instead, you can buy clothes really cheap in China!” And I was like, “Are you completely disconnected from the idea of sweatshops, of child labor?” It’s such walled-in thinking. And I’m like, “Does this guy not have friends who are outside of this bubble?” It’s incredible.<br /><br />But then you see people online who idolize this kind of people. Elon Musk, right after he had joined Trump’s group, and he was tweeting,&nbsp;being an apologist for Trump’s Muslim ban or something like that—I just replied to his tweet, “You’re boring.” I got so many tweets from men all being like, “What have you done? What have you done? Blah, blah, blah.” And I’m like, “Didn’t join Trump’s administration, I didn’t cause a Muslim ban, I’m not apologizing for it.” But these men—it’s like… I just remember telling my CEO, “Do they think he’s going to sleep with them? What is their endgame here? Elon’s going to be like, ‘Oh, this guy defended me against this rando woman—I’m going to hire him and give him a high salary, endless supply of Soylent, young people’s blood.’”<br /><br />And so the parabiosis thing. My point was in that talk—I mean, it’s funny. The idea of this evil man... of course you’re doing that.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Like a cartoon villain.</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Right! I mean, parabiosis is a thing that dictators all over the world do, and it’s—you know, it’s cool to invest in science and stuff like that, but again, is it high priority? And to Peter Thiel, his living forever is a high priority to him. And then people try to be like, “Well, this could be great for everybody,” but it’s like, “We can’t all live forever.” It’s just a very interesting thing where nobody thinks about the greater picture. It’s just kind of this idol who has this idea. And everyone thinks Peter Thiel is the guy who’s going to make parabiosis happen. And it’s like, “It’s already happening. You’re in a bubble. Wake up.” It’s just another frustrating thing. How can we use the research that goes into parabiosis to help people that are not only rich and cohabitating in Silicon Valley and New Zealand and purely evil or whatever? What’s that’s going to be useful for, you know? I don’t know.<br /><br />So yeah—that’s just another—I always think, “Am I the one that’s bananas or…?” It’s just insane. But yeah, the Soylent thing, I always think of… I’m glad that you were saying that that’s how it was framed in the beginning because I’m just like, “If I am correct, this was supposed to actually change the world, but ‘the world,’ not the tech world.” Which people forget. Yeah, tech is pervasive everywhere, but thankfully the culture of tech is not nearly as pervasive in other places.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Why do you think tech culture—like what you said about Elon Musk, especially, is maybe the best example—has this specific kind of hero worshippiness that doesn’t seem to happen as often in other industries?</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>How do we teach these people empathy? They’re not going to learn it from people who make less money than them because, again, that’s what’s driving all of that.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Well, I mean, social media is a big part of that. Elon Musk is someone who tweets. He is someone who is part of really cool futuristic things—I had always been really interested in space travel, and he’s making it happen. He’s good-looking, ish. So he doesn’t really fit the whole nerd thing, although if you look at the old PayPal photos of him and Peter Thiel… huge fucking nerds. But now he’s rich and he’s got some nice suits and stuff like that, so he just seems like a charismatic, smart, doing cool shit. Space travel is cool. Whatever Peter Thiel’s doing—oh, he’s a VC. That’s not cool to me. But Elon Musk is doing cool stuff. People latch on. They’re like, “Okay. It’s okay for him to be your problematic fave.” You know what I mean? Because he’s doing cool stuff.<br /><br />And I thought he was cool, too. And then the whole him joining the Trump administration thing happening, it was just like, “Elon, what the fuck are you doing?” And then him being apologetic for Trump. It was like, “Okay, yeah, you’re just another rich white guy who, like, you know.” I, too, fall victim to that.<br /><br />But I also—when you’re working in tech, you try to look for someone to look up to. There’s not much representation for women or people of color. I mean, whenever people talk about women CEOs, they talk about Marissa Mayer, and she’s fucking dropping the ball. And it’s like, “Oh my god, we’re rooting for you, but…” And people are like, “Oh, are you worried that Marissa Mayer failing at Yahoo will make it harder for women to be CEOs?” It’s already hard for women to be CEOs. Do you find that Marissa not being good at her job is making it hard for you to accept women can be CEOs? Like, flip the switch here, you know what I mean?<br /><br />Then you have women who are in power, like Sheryl Sandberg, and they write these books like <em>Lean In</em>about stuff that’s completely unrealistic to other people, and I’m like—you know, when I was growing up, my dad always—I don’t talk to my father—but he always had this guilt that we grew up without money and we were hungry at times and I was on my own at a young age, and he regrets that he put me through that or whatever. And I’m kind of like, I think I feel more bad for the people who grew up rich who are in that little bubble because they don’t understand the whole experience, and there’s going to be a point when I think something gives, and the rich are going to be the first ones eaten, you know what I mean? And they’re going to wonder what’s going on. I hope that happens in my lifetime, but, I mean, I don’t know.<br /><br />It’s just, okay, my experience means that I have empathy. How do we teach these people empathy? They’re not going to learn it from people who make less money than them because, again, that’s what’s driving all of that. But I just remember seeing <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/161214150919-trump-tech-summit-meeting-group-780x439.jpg\">that picture</a> of all the—Larry Page representing Google at the Trump tech summit thing. I remember thinking, “Aw, Larry, you were supposed to be the cool one.” And seeing him there, Jeff Bezos was there, Sheryl Sandberg was there. I was like, “You’re all a bunch of fucking dirtbags. So complacent. You have all this money to do all this stuff. Be cool. Please, someone be cool.” But I guess you can’t be cool and be in power in 2017.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>That’s a little depressing.</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>I know! Yeah, yeah. It’s a bummer. But I don’t see anarchy happening anytime soon, you know. You see little pockets of it when big protests come out and stuff like that, but, you know.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It feels like there is this growing tension. One thing that’s come up in some of the interviews I’ve been doing is Otto and displacing truck drivers and how that’s the most common job in so many states and at the same time, on the other hand, you have people who are prepping for the apocalypse. It feels like this kind of weird stage of society.</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. People joke about Y2K, but there are definitely people who are prepping at a way bigger level than Y2K preppers were. The automation of jobs is always an interesting thing. Being an engineer—I used to do dev ops, and my job was to automate tasks that I myself was doing. And the whole joke was, “Don’t automate yourself out of a job!” But someone’s got to do the automation, and so I’m automating my own things.<br /><br />So when you see Uber and Google coming through and talking about self-driving cars, and maybe we can do self-driving trucks, it’s like, “You’re not automating your own work. You’re automating other people’s jobs, and that’s an ethical issue.” But no one really cares about ethics. Because of capitalism—I’ll owe two dollars—well, no one else is caring about ethics, so in order for us to be able to compete, we have to have the same moral standards, or lack thereof, as the rest of them.<br /><br />You know, with the whole United flight <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/10/travel/passenger-removed-united-flight-trnd/index.html\">controversy</a>, there’s not much competition within airlines, in the US, at least. I mean, United, American Airlines, they’re all sort of owned by the same company. And so no airline is going to be like, “Yeah, forget United, come fly with us.” There might be international airlines that do that, but not domestic. They sort of work well together instead of competing against each other because there’s enough demand for flying to deal with that, so nothing’s really going to happen with this United thing. I mean, that poor guy is bleeding on a video, and everyone’s watching it, and people are investigating his life, as if a drug felony or whatever is relevant to his refusing to leave a seat that he paid for, you know? But just the American way of thinking is, “Well, what did he do wrong, ever, in his past?”<br /><br />And I think that’s why sexism thrives in the tech industry, because if you were going to report something, you have to make sure that you have a completely flawless background. You have to be white, you have to be preferably blond, good-looking because you don’t want someone to be like, “Oh, nobody would have ever raped you because you’re ugly.” Thin. You had to have probably never have had sex. But a certain age where it’s still okay to be a virgin, so not married yet or whatever. And then you have to maybe be in a relationship with a guy where he hasn’t done anything wrong and he’s also the boy next door. And you have to have everything perfectly documented—it’s like this impossible scenario to be in.<br /><br />So Susan Fowler, who reported the sexism she experienced at Uber—she sort of, kind of fit that mold, where it was flawless. She wrote the whole <a href=\"https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber\">blog</a><a href=\"https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber\">&nbsp;post</a>; she has a new job at a place where they have a better culture (I think she ended up at Stripe); her pinned tweet is a photo of her and her new husband; she’s a cute blonde; she did—I think she was a security engineer—so she did good, important, interesting work at Uber. So it was really kind of an ironclad, rock-hard stance that nobody could really fight. And that must have been so fucking frustrating to Uber. Because then she had tweeted that—Uber had mentioned Arianna Huffington and Eric Holder were going to do an internal investigation even though they were already on the Uber board, so it’s not a real investigation—and she found out that they had a separate lawyer, basically investigating her. And so she was tweeting, “If people are asking you for information about me, they’re trying to start their smear campaign. By the way, this is my new lawyer that I just hired.” And she had hired a law firm. And then things sort of fizzled out.<br /><br />And that was just a really unique position because then it makes you think—she went through a lot of bullshit, but it’s not a unique situation. I’m sure many women at Uber went through that, but they didn’t fit the perfect mold of the white woman who’s eloquent and blogging and all my blogs like that are lowercase and misspelled, you know—people will focus on that! It’s really frustrating not being able to just do your job without worrying about what comes up in the past, you know. It makes me think if I were ever in a situation where I had to report something or I was—I mean, I would never be dragged off a plane, I’m a white woman—but if something of a similar sense were to happen, what would be dragged out about me? You know what I mean? God, they would look at my Twitter, for a start.<br /><br />I don’t know, it’s just very—it’s something that I’m always thinking about, “What will someone misinterpret or what would happen if something were to happen to me? If someone finds my address, what’s my backup plan?” I always tell women who are trying to be more visible online, have a backup plan, in case things happen, and one woman was like, “It’s just exhausting to think about.” I was like, “It is exhausting. We are exhausted.” But we still have to be good at our day job and even better at our day job or else, you know, there’s just a lot more scrutiny on us. And it’s also depressing to talk about because I don’t know how to solve it. So the best thing that I can do is, “Okay, I’m in a position at a good company that’s well known. We’re going to do product. Let’s focus on trying to make the world a better place with the product.” Which, you know, sounds completely un-punk rock and everything that I used to stand for, but at the end of the day, I choose to not work at startups. Nothing that’s funded by Peter Thiel, you know what I mean? So I avoid startups entirely.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>I’m always thinking about, “What will someone misinterpret or what would happen if something were to happen to me?

And I also feel like I have to have an equal voice on my team as other people—I’m the only woman on my team right now. And that hasn’t been a problem yet; it’s only been two months. But we’re a small company, so we’re not completely hiring people all the time, but it would be nice in the future to have more women on the team. And that’s something that the rest of the team recognizes as well. There’s no reason for that not to be the case. So far, so good.<br /><br />And I’m in a position where I feel like if I hit a snag and I felt wronged in any sort of way, I could go somewhere else. And people say to me, “Oh, you could work wherever you wanted.” And I’m like, “That’s not true. But if it were true, there’s not many places I would want to work at because there’s a lot of shit out there.” But from the perspective of a white guy, it’s all these opportunities, you know what I mean?<br /><br />We were talking at lunch about the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/kendall-jenner-pepsi-ad.html\">Pepsi commercial</a>. People were complaining like, “Yeah, the commercial sucked,” and they were drinking Pepsi. And I’m just like—we have Coke—and I’m just drinking my Coke like, “Oh, yeah, sure, yeah.”<br /><br />I had this frustrating meeting yesterday with a bunch of New York City JavaScript meetup organizers I had never met. And they were saying, “Oh, your meetups are great! How do we collaborate?” But I had mentioned how one of the meetups didn’t have a code of conduct, and I was like, “You need to have something in place whenever,” and he was like, “Oh, they’re so negative, though.” And I’m like, “You know what else is negative? Being harassed at a tech meetup.” It was just a really frustrating meeting where I felt like I had to explain myself, and it’s like, “You brought me here to give you advice. I’m giving you advice, and you’re fighting me on it, and I have the experience, and you don’t. So what is the point here? Was the point just to bring a few women”—because a few of my collaborators are women—“a few women in here to make you all feel better about yourselves? Because it’s not going to happen.” It was just a huge waste of my Monday, and so I’ve just been in this mood and then during lunch, I was like, “Ugh.” And then Anil came and was like, “What’s up?” And I’m like, “Ugh! Just had the full dose of the white male experience,” which everyone has who’s not a white male. Ugh, the fucking code of conduct discussion all the time. And then I went on that guy’s meetup site, and there’s a code of conduct on there—he doesn’t—ugh, God. What a world.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>What a world, yeah.</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Unreal, unreal.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It’s interesting, that specific dynamic, where everyone now wants to appear #woke or whatever, but they’re not willing to actually put in the effort. And I feel like the backlash from that is often worse than if you hadn’t tried at all.</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Yeah. It reminds me of when older white people used to say “bling bling” to sound cool, and you’re just like… And this is before the greater discussion of cultural appropriation in social media had come about, and you just think of people who just want to fit in. And it’s easier for them to pick one little thing to be like, “Oh, yeah, I know what that is.” And again, it’s like this performative outrage around the Pepsi commercial, the United flight. It all has an expiration date until the next scandal, and we’re in a world right now where there’s a new scandal every week, and so everyone comes across as way more woke than they actually are. And all I can do is just sit there and drink my Coke Zero, until they do something, which wouldn’t surprise me but would surprise other people. I’ll send another dollar to my friend because—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>How much money do you owe your friend?</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>It’s just ironic—he donates it all. So I’ve been doing a lot more speaking over the past couple of weeks, and so I’ll send him twenty dollars, and he just donates it back to ScriptEd. It’s just this ridiculous thing. It’s the only way to explain all this crazy stuff that’s going on! Anyway, so I judged the <a href=\"http://hackny.org/\">HackNY</a> hackathon over the weekend—they’re this nonprofit and they have a fellowship program for developers and stuff.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, Chris Wiggins.</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Yeah! And so that was cool. They have a new category that was “Best Social Good Hack.” I have all my notes right here. “Use your tech skills for good. Build something that has a positive social impact, be it a visualization that helps educate on an issue or an app that helps solve a problem.” And we got this list of all these apps—there were, like, forty that presented. This was a list of people that competed, and they picked their desired prizes. And I don’t know if it’s just because they wanted—you know—all their chances to get a prize, but there were just some of them that put themselves down for “Best Social Good Hack,” and it was, like, an alarm clock. The alarm clock didn’t even work. It’s just like, well.<br /><br />I’m going to talk to Chris about this, but I think there needs to be a better discussion around what social good so it’s not just seen as another label to pander to people about. Because that was definitely what I was witnessing happening at the hackathon. There were some good social good causes, and those were the ones that I tried to promote to place and stuff. But I think, if anything, it’s really easy to—I mean, for me, it’s easy, and I feel like, if it’s easy for me, it’s easy for a lot of people—thinking, “Okay, these are the skills I have. These could be used for good in some way. The hard part is organizing it.”<br /><br />So with the hackathon, if they have more of a discussion around what it means to be a socially good application developer, they could have some really great things come out of it. I think second place went to—“Period Piece” was the name of it—a man and woman, I forgot what university they were from. They made an app that—I forgot the percentage of homeless people who have smartphones in New York. But it’s a pretty high percentage. So they made an app that would detect your location, and if you’re a woman (or man—whoever, since men also have their periods, and this was period-focused), it would show you a location where there was access to free feminine hygiene products. And it would show you if the shelter had any left because that data is available, thanks to New York City, and where to call if you need to find a place nearby. And also an icon on the app was to donate if you’re not someone in that need but you can donate money toward that cause. So that was a cool thing. And there was someone who was like, “Oh, I feel like that’s been done before,” but it’s a hackathon. Geez.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, what hasn’t been done? Alarm clocks haven’t been done before?</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>Yeah, nothing here is new and innovative, you know what I mean? But I feel like all the apps that people have made could have been used or written in a way to be social good. They’re basically CRUD apps. So I think there just needs to be bigger education and organization around what the needs of people outside of our tech bubble are. Maybe those engineers thought that an alarm clock was a social good thing, but I think they’re wrong, so it’s like, how do we better educate them to what social good is?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Maybe one last question, then. In terms of—what do you think are some ways that tech as an industry or individuals in tech, however you want to interpret it, can do more social good? I think there are a couple schools of thought around, “I’m going to be an engineer at Uber, but maybe I’ll volunteer over the weekends.” Or maybe you should be having a full-time job that aligns more with your values or whatever.</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>I recognize that there’s a lot of privilege in being able to move around and change jobs and stuff. I had a lot of really good friends who used to work at Mozilla, and they worked at Mozilla around the time that Brendan Eich—the then-CEO—came out that he had donated money to Prop 8, and people were like, “Why don’t you leave your job? Why don’t you quit your job because of this?” Without being like, “Oh, this is a complicated situation, maybe we don’t have the whole story or maybe I can’t just quit my job because I have responsibilities or a family or stuff like that.” So I never fault people for that.<br /><br />I mean, if I have friends who are like, “Oh, I’m interviewing at Uber,” I’d be like, “What the fuck are you doing?” I do that for a lot of companies, though. I just say, “Why would you go there when you could go here?” And I help people try to find positions elsewhere. But then again, leases are complicated and all that kind of stuff like that.<br /><br />I think that what you do in your off time is really important. If you’re working at Uber, you’re probably going to make some good money. So put some of that good money into a cause that needs that money more than you do. Volunteering time. Mentoring hackathons. There are people there that could mentor these folks and teach them what social good is. I wasn’t able to go to the hackathon except for the judging, and now I’m like, “Okay, I should have more of a presence, so I’m going to try to be a—forgot what they call them—at the hackathon they had people from Twilio to help teach how to use their API. I would think Glitch should have a presence there, at least give talks about what social good actually is. So I’m going to try to do that and maybe get some folks from my team to try that. Giving talks about meetups about how you feel about things.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>If you’re going to work at a company that is morally questionable, you have to own that. You have to own your situation, and you have to say how you feel. And if you don’t feel comfortable using your own voice in that company, then why are you working there?<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>But also more importantly, if you’re going to work at a company that is morally questionable, you have to own that. You have to own your situation, and you have to say how you feel. And if you don’t feel comfortable using your own voice in that company, then why <em>are</em>&nbsp;you working there? And have conversations with people that aren’t management and can’t get to your management.<br /><br />And maybe you can get help to find a place for you to work. Because again, it’s all in who you know. I always tell new developers, “Go to all these meetups! It might be intense talking to all these people, but all of us have the opportunities that we have because of social media and going to meetups and all of that. So if you’re in a job that you are in because you need the money and you don’t know what else to do but you don’t have a voice and you’re against what they’re about—well, then, you need to try to do something to get out of there, and conversations are the first thing. If anything, having conversations about moral quandaries in your company allows you to articulate to the company why things are bad, and that’s also useful. Because then people are like, “Why did Susan even work at Uber if that thing happened in the first place?” And I’m like, “Oh, maybe this thing happens at a lot of companies.”</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It’s like, “Why do you work in tech?”</p><p><strong>JENN</strong></p><p>And then it’s like, “This doesn’t just happen in tech.” But again, tech is more pervasive and has a higher standard that the leaders have given themselves, so it’s time to hold those people accountable. How depressing would it be if tech became the next Wall Street where people were like, “Oh, yeah, it just sucks,” you know what I mean? I choose not to work—I mean, we’re literally by Wall Street—but I choose not to work at a financial company because that’s not the culture I want. And so I really like tech. I like the problems that come with the stuff I’m doing, so I’m trying to work my hardest in order to make sure that people—especially women younger than me—don’t come in thinking, “I’m not going to tech because that’s, like, you might as well work at Wall Street.”</p>\n</div>"

And I'm just curious—what pushed you to start that?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>In the days following the election—it all feels like a blur, thinking back to the days immediately following the election. I remember people literally sobbing in the cafeteria at my job at the time, in the office where I worked. I was thinking, as a person who was a tech worker, I felt a really strong urge to do something to show that everyone wasn't just going to fall in line. I'm Canadian—it's not like I could vote at the time—and I had worked on Hillary's campaign as a volunteer.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, I think I get what you mean in terms of the perpetual state of helpless rage.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Yes. And, for many years having worked in diversity and inclusion in tech, I would often get people coming to me and saying, \"I'm mad about, angry about the way this particular conference harassment incident went or whatever shenanigans have been occurring. What can I do about it?\" And I would go back to people and say, \"There's these organizations. The best thing that you can do is as a tech worker is to donate to the people who are experts in fixing this problem. You should donate to this group. You should donate to that group. If you care about this bad thing that's happened, vote with your dollars.\"</p><p>The Never Again pledge came as a natural extension of that, which is that, as tech workers, our organizing power is in our ability to just get a new job. And so coming into that pledge was about building that sense of worker power and worker solidarity, to say, \"We're not going to build the database of Muslims. We're not going to build this technology that enables mass deportations. And if we're asked to do that, we are going to quit.\" We wanted to make that clear, that we weren't going to build this technology without a fight.</p><p>I think we were quite rightly criticized as much of the post-Trump \"resistance\" has been, from the perspective of, \"Where were you before? Why wasn't there a Black Lives Matter pledge, with technologists refusing to build police surveillance?\" And there's a lot of stuff in the Valley that is—the systems upon which many of us built our livelihoods are premised upon surveillance, and that surveillance gets used by governments unevenly.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>As tech workers, our organizing power is in our ability to just get a new job.

Obviously, for a lot of people, the election changed everything, but at the same time there was also this wave of, you know, Obama was complicit in a lot of bad things.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Like the deportation machine.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, exactly. It's interesting to see which parts of that are, you know, really valid and which parts can be more counterproductive. Yes, people have been late to a lot of things, but then again it's better to have them here now.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>I think the other thing that I'm really happy people mostly refrained from doing in the time after the election—that was a focus within the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techsolidarity.org/\">Tech Solidarity</a> movement, as much as you could call that movement because it wasn't that formal—was avoiding the sort of Bay Area techno-utopian solutionism of, \"Oh, this bad thing is happening. Let's build an app to fix it.\"</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Which was a whole—there was a wave of that!</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>There was a wave of organizations getting started, and I kept in conversations with people and kept going, \"Do you need to start a new organization? Can you support existing organizations?\" And I think you have to find that balance, right?</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>When there are existing organizations that are highly competent at the work that they’re doing, for the most part, in almost all cases, the best dollars-time-value exchange of Silicon Valley engineer effort into political change is supporting those existing organizations.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>On the one hand, let's throw a bunch of spaghetti against the wall and see what sticks. But on the other hand, when there are existing organizations that are highly competent at the work that they're doing, for the most part, in almost all cases, the best dollars-time-value exchange of Silicon Valley engineer effort into political change is supporting those existing organizations. And I think we were able to pretty effectively redirect that energy to those organizations.</p><p><strong>Jackie</strong></p><p>I had a question about specifically this idea of tech solutionism and how it can be damaging for tech workers to try to fix every problem with a technical solution. Do you feel like that's gotten better? Do you feel like people have gotten more aware of that? And what do you see as the most impactful way that tech workers can actually help other people?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>I think the most impactful way today remains dollars, funding effective organizations doing the on-the-ground social change work. Also, electoral work. I think the 2018 election is the most important election in a long time. It's such a critical juncture for the preservation of the basics of democracy in this country. So getting involved there, whether it's dollars to campaigns or boots-on-the-ground volunteering, the technological infrastructure of electoral politics in this country is—it exists already. There's no single app that's going to fix it.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>So I think the combination of just donating to candidates in winnable areas and boots-on-the-ground volunteering. You know, take advantage of that unlimited time off. Knock on doors in swing states and swing districts and make a difference that way. It's such a critical race. It's going to affect judges. It's going to affect the census. All of this stuff. I don't think it's alarmist to say that the future of American democracy hinges on this race.</p><p>The \"let's build an app to fix XYZ new political problem that has arisen\" was a result of the election. Those efforts did occur, and many of them petered out as I expected they would. But I think that sense of worker organizing and worker solidarity is a thing that has changed in the Valley past the past two years, right? We saw recently that Salesforce employees—I think 650 of them—signed a letter to Benioff asking Salesforce to cancel its contract with ICE. I don't think that would have happened two years ago. I don't think that would have happened under a different president. And that's really important.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>I did want to ask about that specifically. How do you feel about how everything has gone since the Never Again pledge? For instance, in the context of all the current tech worker protests around Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Salesforce, etc. These tech worker activism efforts—do you feel like they've been effective, and how do you see the pledge manifesting more practically?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Yeah. I think this kind of engineer and tech worker activism is a pretty new thing. I think that we, in doing the pledge, were an early instance of it. It's important to acknowledge that our pledge existed within this continuity of worker solidarity, and we owe a lot of credit to the way that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://home.coworker.org/\">Coworker.org</a> has pioneered that work, of using the protections that are afforded to us with the National Labor Relations Act to do things other than just straight-up organizing a union.</p><p>I would love for Googlers to unionize—that would kick ass—but I think it's super important for people working at tech companies to know that that's not the only way to get those protections. As soon as you and a single colleague go to management about working conditions, you are protected under the NLRB. And I mean, that is a thing that even as a—I mean, I was raised by a pack of lawyers. My mom was a labor lawyer in the eighties. In Canada, so maybe that's why I didn't know about the NLRB before the pledge, before meeting the folks from Coworker.org, I didn't know that protected concerted activity was a thing, and that's such a powerful tool.</p><p>It's an incredibly powerful tool in the hands of a set of people who, if they do choose to quit, can go get a job tomorrow. Because tech companies know that their employee base has that power. They know that they need to to act strongly to retain their employees.</p><p>I think one of the examples that we've seen of that was the CTO of ICE, who was supposed to speak at GitHub's conference. And that shit got shut down quickly. I think that's a perfect example of what we're saying, and it's so important to say, \"Hey, no, it's not okay. If you are working at ICE, you are on the side of baby jails. That's not cool. You don't get to come and hang out at our cool tech conference. We're not okay with baby jails.\"</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. Well, one thing I've been discussing with people recently was the contrast between—well, unclear yet, I guess but—the contrast between Project Maven at Google and how that got shut down by employee activism and Microsoft, for instance, which relies more heavily on government contracts and where it might not be possible for employees to change that. So, what next for the employees? Is the next thing to do to quit? In short, when do they decide it's time to stop?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>I think every individual has their own personal Waterloo of what that line is, and it's tricky when what you're building is pretty much just generic plumbing. And then it's like, is it generic plumbing that someone's installing on their own premises? Is it generic plumbing that's infrastructure? If you look at Amazon and GovCloud, Amazon has been hosting the CIA's data centers for many years. I know people who would not work at Amazon because they don't want to be building infrastructure for the CIA. Right?</p><p>I think Salesforce is a good example, right now, where employees do have to make that choice. Do I feel okay continuing to build infrastructure that ICE is using? Where is that specific line—is it if they're literally using the software to manage the babies they're incarcerating, or are they doing some other thing with it? Is that okay? Maybe that's going to be okay for some people.</p><p>There's a reason I'm starting my own thing now, and it's that some of those decisions—I mean, the other reasons that I got my green card, and I now have that option that I didn't have before—but yeah, those ethical lines. I think it's important for each and every individual engineer to have the self-examination of, \"What is a bridge too far for me? What will make me quit?\"</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>I think it’s important for each and every individual engineer to have the self-examination of, “What is a bridge too far for me? What will make me quit?”<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>I think that was the conversation that we started in a lot of ways because, with the pledge, we were saying, \"Hey, our work has an impact on the world. Our work enables things to change in the world for better or for worse, and it's not just by default for better. We can slow down the gears if necessary.\" People often say, \"Oh, well, if so-and-so didn't build this infrastructure for ICE, somebody else would do it.\" But just because somebody else would do it doesn't mean you need to be the one who does. At least make their lives a little bit more difficult.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>And, you know, there are not <em>that</em> many tech companies, large tech companies, in Silicon Valley that can handle certain kinds of problems. It doesn't take that many people to shut it down.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>I think about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naturaltonic/status/796951298222465024\">this one tweet</a> often—I'll send it to you—but it's along the lines of, \"The last line of defense is a bunch of SREs with sledgehammers.\" I think about it so often.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>That makes sense to me. But I guess one other thought is that I have personally mixed feelings about some of these questions because—well, I think it makes sense to quit, but quitting has to to come with a threat that more people will quit, right, or something else will happen. Because if you just quit and you're just no longer there, no longer causing them problems internally, then in some circumstances, that might potentially be viewed as a positive for the company, right?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Yeah, there's cases where the management is relieved. I think about this goofy economic framework from the sixties by an economist named Albert Hirschman. It's <em>Exit, Voice, and Loyalty</em>, and the idea with <em>Exit, Voice, and Loyalty</em> is if you are dissatisfied with an organization or a government or a company, any sort of collection of humans, if you're dissatisfied, you have three options—he later added a fourth, which is neglect—but you can exit, you can leave. You can use voice—you can speak up, you can try to change things. And you can go to loyalty. You accept that your displeasure at the particular circumstances, but you decide to suck it up, essentially. Then the fourth one he later added is neglect, which is that you stay, but you check out. Most engineers have had a job that's in that fourth one.</p><p>In particular, I think it's important to recognize that not everyone can use exit. If your immigration status is dependent on your work. I've certainly been in the position of, like, \"I can't quit a job because I would literally have to leave the country.\" And a lot of people, whether you're in the stage of the green card process where you're stuck in an employer for a particular amount of time or you have economic constraints—a mortgage, a family—a lot of people have these reasons that may slow down their process of exit or prevent it for a certain amount of time.</p><p>But I think it's important to have gone through that thought process. Do I need to start thinking about leaving? Do I need to start putting the wheels in motion? How do I communicate that those wheels are in motion to my management? Just recognizing that the cost—it is a non-trivial cost to replace even just a single engineer at a tech company, both in terms of their actual productive output and the institutional knowledge that they represent. That cost represents worker power. So making your continued presence at an organization contingent on that organization making ethical decisions is honestly one of the most powerful things that tech employees can do.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>Making your continued presence at an organization contingent on that organization making ethical decisions is honestly one of the most powerful things that tech employees can do.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>So you do have an engineering background, right?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>I do, yes.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Me, too. I've been thinking about how most of these discussions center on what I feel like is, in a way, engineering privilege in terms of job options and value to the company and irreplaceability. Do you think—this question could go either one or two ways—how do you think other people who aren't engineers can use the same kind of leverage? Obviously, they can't literally refuse to build something, but maybe it manifests in a different way, or maybe engineers just need to pull extra weight.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Yeah. I think that's true. This privilege that engineers have by being so sought-after is one that isn't evenly distributed among tech employees. I think it's still important that non-engineer employees think about these ethical implications. I think that's where, for instance, protected concerted activity becomes even more important. If you don't have the protection of technical privilege, you still have the protection of the National Labor Relations Act, and using using voice where possible and exit when necessary there, too. It's obviously a harder path, but I think it's still worthwhile. And I think it is important that engineers pull their weight. Because engineers have it way easy in so many ways.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>By the way, could you explain more about protected concerted activity? How does that work?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Yeah. So it's within the National Labor Relations Act. There's this idea of protected concerted activity, which is that if you can convince a single other coworker to advocate for changes in working conditions with you, then your action is protected. So if you are able to convince one other person that—to use a really mundane example—the toilet paper in the bathroom is scratchy, if we work together, and I'm able to convince you that we should go to management and say, \"Can we upgrade the toilet paper? It's not cool,\" they can't fire you because of that.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Oh, I see, wow.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Yeah. Yeah, it is. It is protected—you can't be fired. Concerted—you've done it with someone else. Activity, specifically advocating around labor conditions.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>That's really good to know.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Coworker.org has a really good FAQ and set of resources.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, I saw they hosted an event recently. They're based in New York, right?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>I'd love to to learn more about what they're doing because it seems super interesting.</p><p>Okay, so right now you're working on a company called Tall Poppy to improve employee safety in the face of online abuse, and it's something that I've had on my mind a lot lately. I'm relatively new to my job, and more and more people from my new company have been following me on Twitter. I'm just increasingly conscious of what I'm doing there now. On top of that, there was recently that incident with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/9/17549492/arenanet-jessica-price-guild-wars-2-writer-fired\">Jessica Price getting fired from ArenaNet</a>. I don't know what you're able to discuss right now, but I'm just curious about some of the ways that you're thinking about mitigating those kinds of harms.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Yep. I've been thinking a lot about the situation with Jessica Price, which I think was just awful. And, in many ways, her employer contributed to her continued harassment, which I thought was really unnecessary and unhelpful.</p><p>So what we're building is, as you said, employer-focused. We've been thinking about, like, what would an employee benefit that helped protect people from harassment—what would that look like? What we've come up with so far is a combination of security awareness training—educational tools that help people take proactive steps to lock down their online presence—and incident response when bad stuff does happen.</p><p>Based on my experience—I've been doing this work for about ten years, working with people who've been targeted by trolls, stalkers, and other kinds of creeps to help them recover, prevent further or future harassment, work with law enforcement where appropriate and desired by the target, and, yeah, just work on mitigating what people feel is a nebulous and undefined problem. But it really has only a couple of different patterns to it.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, that makes sense. Do you feel like, in the context of—well, first, what are you thinking when you say that? I just immediately assumed Twitter, but I don't know if that's what you meant.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Twitter's certainly a source of a disproportionate amount of harm, unfortunately. So the couple of different use cases that I've been considering a lot are online mobbing, a lot of stuff related to intimate partner violence. Stalking is sometimes somebody you don't know but often much more often someone you do know who, at some point, had access to some part of your life, and you no longer want them to have access to that part of your life, but they won't let go. Things like revenge porn. So taking a really broad view of safety that goes beyond what people think of as online harassment. It's not just Twitter trolls. It's like, what is the safety aspect of your digital life and the ways that that extends into your offline life as well? Because, you know, we're both millennials—there's no IRL anymore. It's just life.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>There’s no IRL anymore. It’s just life.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, that's a really good point.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>There hasn't been a difference for most of our lives!</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, I do feel like people really try to distinguish between the two. For instance, doxxing, obviously, is really bad. But I think there are also a lot of things that just happen online that are also really bad, and they may not be treated that way beacause they're \"just words.\"</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>\"Why don't you just log off? Why don't you just delete your account?\" Sometimes your account is your job. And even sometimes it's not, but why&nbsp; should people have to narrow themselves down like that? I think there's such a profound, chilling effect on people in general, but in particular women, people of color, LGBTQ folks, people with disabilities, anyone who's underrepresented or marginalized in a particular space, face such a disproportionate brunt of these attacks, of this targeting. And I'm not saying anything new there, but I think the reason that this problem is so important to me is that we're missing out on all these important voices. We're asking women, we're asking people of color, to circumscribe their lives instead of saying, \"Let's help people feel safer so that they can speak out.\"</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>We’re missing out on all these important voices.

You can't post child porn to Twitter, nor should you be able to do that. You can't post copyrighted materials, and they have extensive infrastructure to decide what is and what isn't okay, including in some countries where they hide Nazi accounts. Right? So this infrastructure does exist. There's just been decisions made that say, \"We value the contributions of these, say, Nazis, more than the contributions of the people whose voices they're silencing.\"</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>What you mentioned before made think of that, because it's similar to how when you allow unfettered free speech, in reality, you're not. Giving some people the power to say whatever they want prevents other people from speaking.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>My friend—I picked up my phone to find the tweet by my friend Martin Shelton—\"The thing conference organizers need to know about failing to kick out toxic people is that they're still choosing who's going to leave.\" I think that that applies to online spaces as well, so much. And the platforms do have a legitimately difficult set of decisions, many, many, many decisions to make as to where those lines are, and it requires really careful application of human judgment. It isn't a problem that machine learning can solve, except a few cases, and particularly because any sort of algorithms and machine learning that you set up to combat this problem will immediately be exploited and weaponized against marginalized people. So it's a legitimately tricky problem. But so far the incentives for tech companies have been growth, growth, growth, engagement, engagement, engagement. As we've seen by the bad take economy—I think it's really important to remember to be thoughtful when sharing bad takes.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>How much are you amplifying?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>How much are you amplifying? And it's different from \"don't feed the trolls.\" So often, targets get told, \"Don't feed the trolls,\" and there's no one correct strategy. There's no one response that's going to make everything okay. And so, as people deal with different kinds of harassment or just bad experiences online, it's important for everyone to figure out what works for them. Maybe tweeting screenshots of the shit that you're getting in your mentions makes you feel better and makes you feel less alone. Then that's okay. You should do that. If that makes you feel less alone and, thus, you can handle the onslaught more, that is a perfectly legit coping strategy. If just ignoring, if muting or blocking, is what works for you, is what makes that feel survivable, you should absolutely do that. If proactively blocking people by using Block Together or \"blockchain\" tools, that is a great strategy as well for the people that want to use it.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>So often, targets get told, “Don’t feed the trolls,” and there’s no one correct strategy.

What do you see as the most impactful changes that they could make?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>It honestly cracks me up that Twitter hasn't solved the crypto spam problem. Like, I never tweet about cryptocurrency. I sometimes tweet about computer security, and I still get cryptocurrency spam. I do report it every time as spam, and it just astonishes me that it ever even crosses the threshold for me.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>I feel like sometimes people say like Twitter is certainly capable of stopping Nazis, for instance, because they can fight spam.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Because they do it in some countries.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, that's true. But, specifically for the crypto spam, it's like—that's not good for their bottom line, I assume. It has to be bad for verified users to be getting impersonated by crypto spammers.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Yes, incentives are—I mean, the incentives are opaque. The reality is, I'm not going to stop using Twitter just because I get a couple crypto spam tweets a week. I'm just going to be mad at them.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Are they impersonating you, or are they—</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>No, I haven't been targeted by any of the impersonation. I think they have gotten better shutting down that behavior, although I'd have to talk to the folks who've been hit with it to be sure. But just signal-boosting—\"check this account out!\" Blah, blah, blah. The type of spam that you think would be pretty easy to catch. None of it looks new. A point that I think Sarah Jeong was the first to raise in her book, <em>The Internet of Garbage</em>, is that there are many types of online harassment that are really similar in nature to spam, and spam is a pretty solved problem today, except on Twitter, as we were discussing.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Similar in nature as in?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>You have false positives, you have false negatives. It's text-based. I think that's particularly true for the high-volume mobbing style of online harassment. I think that's super, super true, and building platforms in ways that make it easy to direct a mob at someone is one of the problems that we've seen. Like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/4333499/india-whatsapp-lynchings-child-kidnappers-fake-news/\">WhatsApp struggling in India with the recent lynchings</a>. Figuring out, what are the parts of the system that you can tweak to reduce that? It can be obviously tricky because virality is the growth engine of so many of these tools, but that's also the engine of harm. Well, it can also be the engine of harm.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. WhatsApp is a good example of a design decision that inadvertently had a lot of impact. They chose to make this feature where you can forward a message without making it look like a forward or whatever, and it turns out to be a pretty bad vector for misinformation, abuse, and so on. Or like Twitter. Do you have any thoughts on how companies can try to anticipate or get ahead of these kinds of issues?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>It makes me think back to the Google Buzz story a bajillion years ago. I'm going to hopelessly botch it, so you'll want to fact-check it.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, I don't think I really know what it is—I've heard of it!</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>So what happened was, when you opted into Buzz, it would auto-friend you with everyone in your address book. But that included if you had been forwarding emails to your email account. The example—again, I am probably botching it—say you had been corresponding with someone using an email address that you had forwarded. And so you were replying by selecting to reply from that other account, so they didn't know your real email account. Right? So say your shitty ex is emailing this other email address, which forwards to your Gmail, and you reply, and you change the \"from\" field to that other email, and so they never see your real Gmail account. Well, shitty ex still gets added to your Google Buzz feed, thereby revealing your actual email account. And that really <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nytimes.com/2010/02/13/technology/internet/13google.html\">happened</a> to a blogger I followed the time.&nbsp;I guess that would have been 2011, maybe?</p><p>That's a whole long story to say, if you'd had anyone in that room who had ever dealt with a stalker or an abusive ex. They would have been like, \"Whoa, Nelly. Can we not disclose this whole friend list? Can we not auto-add anyone and everyone in your address book?\" The point I'm making is, if you have people in the room who aren't like you, and you're thinking through these ethical and design decisions, you're going to make better decisions, and you're going to make decisions that prioritize safety. Again, I feel like it isn't a new thing to say, but I think it's so important with safety-related design choices that you have people with a variety of life experiences. Not just a bunch of hoodie-wearing male Stanford dropouts and/or grads.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>If you have people in the room who aren’t like you, and you’re thinking through these ethical and design decisions, you’re going to make better decisions, and you’re going to make decisions that prioritize safety.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Do you feel like D&amp;I efforts have been getting better? Or do you feel like they've stalled?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>I think we're in an interesting moment where the the research is really well-established on how necessary diversity is, but we don't yet know about that many effective interventions. We know about some, and a lot of companies are still deploying the known effective interventions. I think there's still a lot of room for trying new ideas. We haven't moved the needle that much, is what I'm saying. We've moved the needle some, and we have transparency around the extent of the problem, and both of these steps represented a lot of progress. But we still have a ton of work to do, and we still have some major parts of the problem to address.</p><p>The part of the problem that I've been really focused on fixing for much of the time that I've done D&amp;I work is less the entrance of the pipeline and more about keeping people in the industry. Selfishly, I want tech to be an industry where I want to continue working. I love building tools. I love messing around with computers. I love using them as tools to make cool things happen in the world. One of the reasons I went to the ACLU is to figure out if I wanted to go to law school or not. And I love working with lawyers, but it turns out I don't really want to be one, so now I'm like, \"Well, there's that plan!\" So now I'm back to wondering, \"How do I build a tech company where I want to work?\"</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. It's sad. I'm fairly young. I've been working for two-and-half years, not a long time, and it's wild, the number of people I know who are already super burnt out. It doesn't take long. And so I see all these people who've been here for, I don't know, a decade or longer, and I'm just like, \"How do we get there?\" I was tweeting with someone recently about how we can't wait until we're all senior engineers and can contribute to building teams and hiring good people and all of that. But we just have to stay for that to happen.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Oh, my heart.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>There was an Erica Baker tweet a while back about how we keep having the same Diversity 101 discussion. How do we get to—</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Graduate-level? Yeah, so one of the hats that I wear is that I have taught a workshop called the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://adainitiative.org/continue-our-work/workshops-and-training/\">Ally Skills Workshop</a> a bunch of times. So Valerie Aurora created the workshop. We worked together. I was a founding advisor to the Ada Initiative, which was her and Mary Gardiner's nonprofit. And teaching the workshop—I think the workshop is a really effective intervention, and I wish every tech company had it—I think what's great about it is that it does focus on that retention piece. It focuses on how to build an actual work environment that is friendlier and more welcoming to people who are underrepresented. When bias does happen, how do you address it in the moment? How do you tackle those microaggressions before they become macroaggressions?</p><p>That work has felt really powerful and effective in the time that I've done it. It's also work that has a ripple effect. I've been teaching the workshop during, but not at, those security summer camp conferences in Las Vegas every year. This year is the first year I'm missing teaching it in four years, and I'm bummed about that, but there's this whole starting a company thing that's taking a lot of my time. Anyway, one of the interesting parts about having taught it to close to a hundred people, just in that little bubble of the security community—I've taught it elsewhere in the security community, too—just within that set of people, I've seen the sort of effects of the workshop ripple out because it is giving people who have shared values around diversity and inclusion a set of tools to be able to be effective advocates. I I feel like it's made a big difference.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, that's really great. That's super cool. Okay, one more question, then. We've talked about a lot of not-so-cheery subjects. What do you see as exciting you most? It could be technology-related. It could be industry-related.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Not to toot my own horn, but I'm really excited about getting to work full-time on helping people stay safe. I think that, in many ways, I've had this day job of standard corporate computer security work, and then I've had my advocacy hat of diversity and inclusion from my work with the Ada Initiative and other diversity efforts and teaching the workshop. But really the third big piece of my heart for the past ten years has been doing one-on-one security work with individuals who are facing harassment and just getting the chance to scale up that work, to help more people than I, as an individual, can address—that is what I'm really the most stoked to do. Everything about—like, I really don't want to be a bad example of working ridiculous hours, but I'm just so motivated.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It's fine if you <em>choose</em> to do it! It's just bad if your boss makes you or you make other people do it!</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>I think that even when you are the boss, yeah, no one is sustainable at eighty hours a week. Yeah. No one. It's not possible. And there's a very real example that you're setting for other people. Obviously, I don't have any employees yet, but I think it is so important to be setting an example in terms of how you act as a leader and not pulling heroics. Not building a hero culture is really important.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>It is so important to be setting an example in terms of how you act as a leader and not pulling heroics.

How has starting a company been?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>It's been really exciting. It's been really fun.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>How long have you been technically working on it?</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>So my last day at the ACLU was May 11, and my first day working on Tall Poppy was May 12. That was a Saturday. You know, I've been working in my evenings and weekends to start the preparations for getting it incorporated and all that paperwork jazz, but I really got everything rolling after I left the ACLU. It's been full tilt since then. It's been a blast.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>That's the dream!</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Yeah, I feel really incredibly lucky to have the chance to do it.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It's exciting someone's trying this approach with a company. It feels like it's just this problem that exists, and you think about it, and you're like, \"Well, that's awful.\"</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>I think the key part for me was thinking through where in the system of entities and organizations that might take action about online harassment, where is there any leverage? Nonprofits that are doing direct service. There are a lot of incredible organizations out there that are doing this work. Many of them have struggled with finding that consistent funding source, and, if nothing else, I want to take some of the weight off of them by being a service provider to people whose companies have said, \"We care about this problem.\" I have already been in conversations with working to partner with and support the organizations that are doing this really important work with individuals, but I want to just take a chunk of this burden and just handle it.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It's timely, too. I think people are becoming increasingly aware of this problem.</p><p><strong>LEIGH</strong></p><p>Yeah. I think it's really been top-of-mind for HR and general counsel and security teams. Between situations like #MeToo happening and that affecting people who have jobs and positions within organizations, whether or not that organization is related to the #MeToo situation about which they're speaking out—often, the #MeToo cases that we're seeing are events that happened a while ago, and the target has moved on to another organization but still wants to be able to speak out about it. And I think as we figure out how to be better about addressing abuse within organizations, one of the important pieces of the puzzle is, how can organizations support their employees and their colleagues when they are doing the very important work of speaking out or becoming whistleblowers?</p>\n</div>"

He previously covered technology at Recode.</h3><h3>At the VICE office in Williamsburg, he talked to me about the relentless trend toward monopolism among big tech companies and what he sees as their eventual reckoning.</h3>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>So do you want to tell me a little bit about yourself, how you started getting into covering tech?</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p><p>Sure. I'm twenty-four. I went to UC Berkeley, and it was around my sophomore year of college I started looking around and realizing I knew a lot of really smart people who were going to work in Silicon Valley. And I wasn't super familiar with the tech industry or anything, but it just struck me, \"Why do I know so many people doing this when I don't know that much about it?\" So I started reading technology news and paying attention to the trade publications, and I began reading Valleywag a lot, the now-shuttered Gawker blog that covered and lampooned Silicon Valley, and eventually decided this is a thing I'm interested in.<br /><br />And so then—I guess it would have been my junior year of college—I applied for an internship at Recode, which had just launched. And I got it, so I started working for them in the spring of 2014, and I left last year, so I was there about two and a half years. And my interest really just stemmed out of, not any abiding love for gadgets or something, but just kind of because I was like, \"This seems like a place where there's a lot of power.\" It's like, Silicon Valley's increasingly become dominant, and it seems relevant. I got into tech journalism at a pretty good time.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>So one thing I'm curious about, then—what do you think of the relationship between tech as an industry and journalism? Because I feel like it is different from a lot of other industries, and there's a lot more intermingling.</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>Silicon Valley resists accountability journalism, and it resists a lot of straight news reporting. It resists all these traditional metrics or standards for accountability.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Yeah, I would say that Silicon Valley resists—most big businesses, I don't think Silicon Valley is unique in this regard—resists accountability journalism, and they resist a lot of straight news reporting. It resists all these traditional metrics or standards for accountability. You know, a few years ago, there was this really big debate about, when Valleywag was still around—I'd say 2013, maybe, when this debate was happening—but it was this conversation about, \"Should we really make fun of tech blogs for covering Silicon Valley in a really sympathetic kind of way? Maybe it's more useful to look at them as trade publications.\"<br /><br />And I think that debate fell by the wayside, and that really intense interrogation—specific interrogation of tech and trade publications—because tech became so powerful and Silicon Valley became so powerful that at a certain point people—it just moved on. The conversation moved on because everyone started caring about what Silicon Valley was doing, especially as just a handful of companies emerged becoming seriously dominant. Like Uber, Airbnb, and so on. And you saw less of these plucky consumer-facing startups commanding your attention. Like, Clinkle ran out of money, the photo-sharing startup Color died, and all that kind of stuff. And you saw real big specific players emerge dominant.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. So what do you think the relationship now? For a lot of companies, like Uber and Airbnb, for instance, journalism has been a big part of acting as—</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p><p>I mean, this is what sucks about it, when you have really large companies like Airbnb and Uber staying private. You don't have to interrogate their financials—they don't have to be interrogated over their financials by investors. You know, the founders have tremendous power over their boards. All of the traditional ways that you hold a company accountable are—they're limited. Let me rephrase it. Journalism has not necessarily gotten better—it's not like there's qualitatively better journalism that is suddenly holding all these companies to account. It's just that it is the only measure of public accountability when these companies do not have to be as forthright as other large public companies.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>Journalism has not necessarily gotten better—it’s not like there’s qualitatively better journalism that is suddenly holding all these companies to account. It’s just that it is the only measure of public accountability when these companies do not have to be as forthright as other large public companies.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>And that is just when we're talking about the large, late-stage massively venture- and private equity-funded companies like Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, whatever. I think the bigger issue is when you look at companies like Apple or Google or Amazon. Because they create so much shareholder value they have done a really good job of escaping the ways we talk about other really large companies with similar market share or dominance. Like Monsanto or something.<br /><br />And so, instead of talking about, \"Gee, Google and Facebook together basically have a stranglehold over digital advertising—what does that say about Google and Facebook?,\" you know, it's really hard to shape the idea that these are companies that have this kind of power and can have sometimes deleterious impacts on industries in which they operate, when we still think of Google as the company that said, \"Don't be evil,\" or Facebook as the company that wants to supply internet from drones in rural areas. It's really hard to kind of square those things, and I think journalism as a whole in covering them has not really figured out a way to do that.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Do you think that that's something that will change or maybe is changing already? Because there is very much this sense of—even Google is still viewed as an underdog, despite the fact that it's one of the most valuable companies in the world.</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p><p>I mean, maybe. I think journalism is definitely, obviously changing. I don't know if it's for better or worse at this point. I don't know if it means that the coverage is going to get better or whatever. I think that the model of media and news media in general—the business models—do not work very well, and it's very obvious to anyone who pays attention for even a split second. So when you think about that—I think that journalism gets better when journalism is more stable, when there are ways to make money doing journalism. I think that it is a really tortured relationship between the fact that Google and Facebook make so much money as middlemen, as advertisers and platforms in ways that siphons some money out of media.<br /><br />And that's their business, and it's fine that it is their business. I'm not so sure that it's fine and I really think it needs to be probed whether or not the scale at which they have achieved that is necessarily working out for everyone. Because I'm not suggesting that print ad revenues are magically going to be restored or that print subscriptions are going to come back and the money that those brought in are going to be magically restored if you took on Google and Facebook, but they account for so much of the growth in digital advertising that if you can't really grow journalism beyond these kinds of niche models—<em>The Information</em>&nbsp;or something, really premium paywalls—then I think we could be in a lot of trouble. The quality of journalism may improve in some publications, but as a whole, the thing could get really bad.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>Journalism gets better when journalism is more stable, when there are ways to make money doing journalism.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. Do you have any thoughts on the convergence of media and tech? Because I feel like this is a more common thing, for media companies to be tech companies that are raising venture capital and stuff like that.</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p><p>I mean, we're sitting in the office of a place that has exactly pursued that model. I think tech investors have largely wised up. You don't hear as much as you did a few years about media companies like Mashables and Vices and BuzzFeeds or whatever, or smaller competitors, raising money from venture capital like that. The margins of media are not the same as the margins in software. It's just very simple.<br /><br />And I think you see a lot of consolidation in media that kind of reflects that fact—you see a few dominant players who all have roughly the same business model, with somewhat different approaches, and yeah. Media companies pretending that they're tech companies is something that doesn't hold because the business doesn't make sense, and if the business doesn't make sense, you can only delude people for so long, and then investors realize it and stop giving money to media companies. And I think we've already seen that happen.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>That makes sense. Another thing that I was kind of thinking about was—just for—we have seen sort of the rise of these really, really large tech companies have monopolies, kind of, in certain areas, but are not really being viewed that way. For instance, Amazon is—I don't know about universally loved, but at least by its customer base. I forget, there was that Economist article that was like, more than half of each new dollar spent online in the US—</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>At its core, that’s what the theory of disruption is. The idea that you kneecap all of your competitors with some sort of specific special sauce, whether it’s software, whether it’s, you know, eliminating their market and supplanting all of them at once, but it ends, the arc of that story, about a founder, ends in monopoly.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>53% of online commerce growth is Amazon. That's an e-marketer's numbers from very recently—you can check that. For sure, one of my areas of focus is antitrust and monopolism in tech. And I think the way that these tech companies will evolve—the next stage is that they're going to have to confront the fact that they're so powerful and so big and regulators did not intervene. And then it's also going to have to lead us to ask, \"Why did regulators and why did the market not realize that this was monopolistic consolidation?\"<br /><br />And I think it's because of a couple of things. I think it's because the animating philosophy of disruption in Silicon Valley. I mean, if you go back to Clay Christensen and the guy who inspired him, his mentor Porter—those guys basically made it become kosher that monopolism was okay. At its core, that's what the theory of disruption is. The idea that you kneecap all of your competitors with some sort of specific special sauce, whether it's software, whether it's, you know, eliminating their market and supplanting all of them at once, but it ends, the arc of that story, about a founder, ends in monopoly. Peter Thiel's book,&nbsp;<em>Zero to One</em>, is, I think, a very good example of that. How he talks about Google—the drive of a startup should fundamentally be monopolistic in that view. And Silicon Valley doesn't use the word monopoly, though.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>They use \"scale.\"</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p><p>I think it's very obvious how they think of themselves as not monopolists. Nobody says, like, \"Oh, we're Standard Oil.\" We all know how that ends. And they know it has bad effects. They know. But at the same time, you know, they don't view themselves that way. They view themselves as saviors of the world, and they view themselves as people doing work that governments can't do and that no one else can do. Nevermind the fact that it was DARPA that invented the internet, the basis of what they call their innovation of this regard. Or that, you know, it was incredibly regulated monopolies, like Ma Bell (AT&amp;T) that were the companies that advanced a whole lot of innovation as well.<br /><br />There's this idea and this delusion that only in the way that Silicon Valley is currently constructed, with no regulatory intervention and basically VCs playing casino odds on who might be the monopolist in a certain kind of market—although admittedly of course, there's more competition in some tech markets than others—but the idea that the platform-ism is, in itself, something that doesn't ultimately end in monopoly is deeply frustrating to me as a reporter because it's just so obvious.<br /><br />And in Amazon's case, you know, I think history repeats itself a lot, and Amazon and Uber are really good examples when you compare them. Amazon spend years, years, years, years, years—I think Matt Yglesias at Vox had this line that was like, \"Amazon is like a Wall Street-subsidized experiment in consumer welfare theory,\" the idea being that this classic Chicago school idea of consumer welfare, which is really price theory, meaning that something cannot be anticompetitive if it just results in lower prices for consumers. Because the thinking is that the consumers are the people who are affected negatively by anticompetition.<br /><br />And I think what's essential to understand is that Amazon figured that out and then constructed market dominance by figuring out, \"Alright, we can build power in all these different directions as long as the fundamental goal is to lower prices for consumers.\" And Uber's idea of consumer welfare isn't necessarily low prices, although it's supplanting taxi cabs, and the goal of the company is ultimately to augment, if not replace, mass transit, which is a way of conforming to low prices, but, you know, it's this idea of access and how quickly things come. They define these initially as luxuries, like they did with uberBlack cars or whatever, but when they expanded with uberX and uberPool, it became about access and convenience.<br /><br />And that's a different kind of maximizing consumer welfare. Nevermind if it's anticompetitive behavior that they're engaged in to get there, to get to this point, which they may be. It's the same thing with Amazon; it doesn't matter because the consumer wins. And if the consumer wins, therefore, it has to be good. Like, if you get free email from Google, then it has to be good—nevermind if your private information is suddenly made available to everyone else or if Google takes liberties with who owns what information. You get free email... how can it be bad?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Do you think that there's a way to make those sorts of tradeoffs more apparent to the average user?</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p><p>I mean, I think it's twofold. I think that it shouldn't be the job of you, me, and my friends—not as professionals—to suddenly demand of Google or develop this really sophisticated awareness of the relationship between Gmail and advertisers or whatever. I think it's really incumbent upon people who should know better, like judges. So, to me, it has to be about changing what judges and regulators think—and, frankly, also changing what the industry thinks.<br /><br />I think citizen activism is obviously going to be a big part of it, to make things change, but I think a similarly big part of it has to be in reorienting it and aggressively showing a lot of people at the FTC, FCC, DOJ, that this is the reality, and your forty years of Chicago school antitrust thinking that is dictating the way we view competition policy is failing us.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>I think citizen activism is obviously going to be a big part of it, to make things change, but I think a similarly big part of it has to be in reorienting it and aggressively showing a lot of people at the FTC, FCC, DOJ, that this is the reality, and your forty years of Chicago school antitrust thinking that is dictating the way we view competition policy is failing us.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>And it's not just in tech, by the way. I think that Silicon Valley's where it's very exaggerated—if you look at the top five companies in the world by market cap, they're tech companies. Facebook, Apple, Google. It's obvious that it's exaggerated there. But you can see it with airlines, you can see it with all sorts of companies. You see consolidation and sort of a trend toward monopolism. It's pervasive. It's everywhere. I think in Silicon Valley, though, because it's so exaggerated, that ups the obligation to do something about it. Talk about it, deal with it.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Okay, this is a total pivot, but another thing I've been thinking about is tech culture and how that's this weird cultlike thing, in the sense of—there are all of these sort of more niche—there are things like Soylent, for instance, which is niche, and then there are pseudoreligious practices. Like, there are people who got into that Zen fasting thing a while back, and then there's Burning Man—there are just all these sort of weird parts of tech culture and I don't know if you have any thoughts on why that manifests that way?</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p><p>The why I'm not so sure I have a good answer to. I think the how is that it's because when you get—Silicon Valley is a land of abundance in a lot of ways. For the fact that the two most important resources there are scarce—land and water—everything else is in abundance, money and all that. So I don't necessarily think of—I think of the Burning Man stuff as just similar to Bonfire of the Vanities. Any culture or time or historical moment, especially in recent years, when you have an ascendant industry with an enormous amount of cultural capital. We start paying attention to all of the rituals that are particular to them.<br /><br />In Silicon Valley's case, these are pretty outlandish. They're also intimately wrapped up in culture. I think—and I don't just mean that in a one-to-one thing about, \"Oh, wow, Silicon Valley is an HBO show,\" but I mean in that—it's like Youtube creators are popular with kids. The medium and the means through which we express a lot of culture now comes from these companies. And then it makes you think, \"Oh, what's the culture like in the place that generated this thing?\"<br /><br />I don't think that it's some specific process by which people make that linear connection, but I think it sort of explains, \"Why do people want to see Jesse Eisenberg play Mark Zuckerberg?\" It plays into that. And then there was also a lot of mythmaking that happened in the 90s and 2000s, the early 2000s, that preceded all of this. Like the Steve Jobs as visionary thing. There was all these kinds of behaviors and norms that were calcified well before the Ubers and Facebooks and even Googles took flight. And I think that those were—</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>They definitely feed on each other.</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p><p>And it's also because we care so much because it is the one, outside of finance—tech is the best place you can be. There's a reason Google and Facebook are so admired, and it's because they pay well. They make money. You don't get the impression as a worker there that you're working for Monsanto, to go back to that as an example of a conventional evil conglomerate or whatever. You see those companies or these new Silicon Valley companies and the vanguard as being places where it's okay to go make a lot of money. And so it makes sense that the magnifying glass gets put on them. I think that the magnifying glass gets larger. I don't think that Silicon Valley culture is particularly special; I don't think that it's necessarily deserving of this kind of scrutiny.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Sure, yeah. I guess the thing that I felt was that it seems like the more people work in technology and use technology, the more they seek out this realness of experience, that's kind of related to Burning Man and kind of related to—everyone seems to always be going to do something that involves self-reliance in the wilderness and stuff.</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p><p>I think that that's just because they're experiences that you buy and pay for. It's all commoditized, you know? Commodified. You're not doing—the idea of self-improvement and all this stuff. I don't know, there's probably a more serious sociological theory of where that kind of behavior and school of thought comes from. I guess where I get wrapped up and what irritates me more than anything is the idea that there is any kind of authentic experience—that there is something authentic about going to Burning Man or something. It's not—all of it is rehashed.<br /><br />I'm sorry. I work at Vice, and I think that most of the shit I enjoy—what many people would term authentic, edge millennial shit—is warmed-over interpretions of stuff that other people did. And that's fine. It's corporate America. It's kind of how it's supposed to be. What is just much more grating to me is this idea that, \"Nah, man, we're really doing it.\"<br /><br />Like, how many people do you think use Airbnb because they get a sense of community and authenticity and experience from it that aren't people who are just overwhelmed by the novelty of it or largely older folks? Most people do it because Airbnbs are cheaper than hotels and because there are a lot of people, especially our age and a few years older, who grew up in the heart of the Great Recession and very quickly got used to the idea of making compromises that previous generations wouldn't have, on things like hotel rooms or eating out and stuff like that. That's why you see the rise of all these other things like high-end fast food, like Shake Shack or whatever. Or Chipotle, whose business has admittedly been suffering lately because of the whole E. coli thing.<br /><br />But you get what I mean. I think there is—it's all—everything looks the same. All the offices look the same. It's all aimed toward some idea—there's some weird arc toward authenticity that everyone wants to move along—it just doesn't make sense, and they're doing it because it's just what shiftless millennials do, I guess. When traditional norms and senses of community have been so totally torn asunder by the state of the world today and of the last few years.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Cool. Tragic, but cool.</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p><p>Yeah, sorry, I'm not the most happy-go-lucky guy.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, I think very few people I'm talking to are. It wouldn't be the most interesting conversation. So I guess another thing that I'm thinking about is the future impact of technology on society. And I don't know what the best way to think about that is necessarily, but sort of in between looking at the past two or three decades and then the next couple—what that might look like.</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>There are fewer new firms being created than ever before, and the firms that do created employ less people. We see these trends of consolidation in everything, and we’re going to have to unwind it.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>I mean, I would say that the most important things we're going to see is, you know, looking at the election of Trump, it's just very obvious that we have chasmic social inequality on so many other levels. And tech companies are going to have to reconcile that, at best, they barely move the needle on it, and at worst, they exacerbate it, if not cause it dramatically. Economic dynamism, new firms get started—you know, this is the greatest irony. For all the talk that we're in some startup—people recognize the power of the startup, whatever—there are fewer new firms being created than ever before, and the firms that do created employ less people.<br /><br />We see these trends of consolidation in everything, and we're going to have to unwind it. That's how—if we want to talk about technology and society coexisting, I think that a lot of these conversations about stuff like the Singularity and the coming AI hordes in the Elon Musk kind of breathless way is a really nice way of circumventing what is fundamentally a political conversation.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Interesting.</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p><p>And the question of political economy. And how you divvy up resources. And I wouldn't say this in public or scream it on Twitter, but I think it's really fucking childish and irritating. It betrays a fundamental lack of curiosity in how the world actually works and is instead childish imagineering about the kind of world you want to make it, based upon the cool engineering work the people you pay do. It's not thinking about—what are the realities of who has power, how do they use it, and how is it entrenched? And a cabinet full of billionaires and how health outcomes for people are becoming worse and worse and worse and the failure of people on both center left and, of course, obviously, the Republicans to recognize these realities and contend with them in a serious way is—it's maddening.<br /><br />And on the other hand, you have these Y Combinator people who say, \"Oh, we want to do UBI [universal basic income].\" And UBI is—think about this. The reason that UBI is acceptable to people like that is because it immediately accepts the premise that they've won. It immediately accepts the premise that the robots are coming, and they're going to replace everyone. And so it's not even a conversation about—how do we create, how do we implement a policy tool that best serves everyone at this stage and can accommodate for all of these structural inequalities that people face, whether it's a result of rampant corporatism or general class greed or racism or gender discrimination? Instead, the robots are coming, and that's it. There's no consideration of ideology or anything in this. It's all about boring technocratic—picking between the different solution levers you have in front of you without considering how you really create the best possible outcomes. Which is, in itself, an ideological thing. But it irritates me endlessly.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>The reason that UBI is acceptable to people like that is because it immediately accepts the premise that they’ve won.

Do you think there is room for thought around that? Thought around AI, Singularity, whatever stuff that is more—</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p><p>I mean, AI and all these forces are already, and have been for years, steadily affecting the workforce in dramatic ways. It's not novel. I think what's harder is, you know, Ray Kurzweil's half-baked bullshit—which is unacademic, unserious, and is just something that rhetorically carries a lot of weight in Silicon Valley because Silicon Valley is full of people who love to use the word \"futurist.\" And it's a very easy way to lump that kind of stuff together without seriously considering either the science involved or the broader implications—I think not of the Singularity, but of what happens every step until there, and do you really think that we're going to have AI that overpowers humans before we overheat the planet, boil ourselves to death?<br /><br />And that leads to my other thing—Elon Musk, for example. His grand vision, everything he imagines doing, is some conception of history that ends with Elon Musk getting on a space shuttle to Mars. This idea that we have to leave our world behind and go to Mars. And this is a guy with billions of dollars at his disposal, now has the ear of the president, and he's working with the Republican administration that has no interest in dealing with climate protections or reversing climate change or working to at least negate the damage and make this a livable place for as many people as possible. And instead he wants to build a first-come, first-serve service to ship people to Mars in twenty years. I call bullshit.<br /><br />It's not a way forward. And that is what these Singularity AI people do. And of course we should be weirded about AI and have serious conversations about the ethics of this kind of thing. Of course I'm not saying that we shouldn't. It's just that—what they're not talking about is a serious conversation. What they're talking about is fantasy. And it's fantasy that is widely accepted because it's a very convenient fantasy for Silicon Valley. Convenient like Y Combinator's UBI experiment, convenient like—I don't know—drones that provide internet also gets Facebook a whole lot of new customers convenient.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>I guess one last thing, then. What is the thing that concerns you most about technology?</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>When push comes to shove, how will society deal with the fact that rich people and wealth-holding classes, many of whom increasingly come from Silicon Valley, have to give something up to create a more just and equal and equitable society? How will society reconcile with that?<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>It's not the technology itself, so much. Technology's malleable. Code can be rewritten. To me, what's harder is the questions of power. Let's say you accept the premise that Google and Facebook have a stranglehold in digital advertising, and you have to break them up in some way. That fundamentally means that you have to drain some zeroes from the bank accounts of the people who invest in Facebook, who control Facebook. Same deal with Google. And anything that results in those people losing money is going to face intense resistance. What does that look like?<br /><br />And if that is the case—it's a zero-sum—are political institutions going to be comfortable with that? Are Silicon Valley leaders going to recognize that? Are all of the nonprofits and thinktanks and universities that have accepted their money as a means of surviving in an age in which public funding is declining—are they going to accept that? When push comes to shove, how will society deal with the fact that rich people and wealth-holding classes, many of whom increasingly come from Silicon Valley, have to give something up to create a more just and equal and equitable society? How will society reconcile with that?<br /><br />It's the fundamental question of our time, in my opinion, and I can't imagine a world in which it happens without an enormous amount of friction. And I don't want to theorize about what that looks like—I don't know if it's violent or if it's just angry people writing op-eds at one another or whatever.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Medium posts.</p><p><strong>NOAH</strong></p><p>Yeah, exactly. Except I have a funny feeling it's going to look a little more like the first image, of violence, than it is Medium posts. Because things are already very violent. Evictions in Silicon Valley are violent. Homelessness is violent. I can't imagine that violence not continuing for a long time.</p>\n</div>"

Where do you see it filling the gap? And how?</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>I see technology hopefully filling the gap in terms of access—giving people more access to capital, information, etc., so they can make better decisions and better themselves.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>I don’t know whether I’ll say \"in government.\" I’m thinking of tech outside of the government. Basically operating under the idea that the government will fail and try to destroy us in certain respects, so we have to figure out how to create lives for ourselves outside that but also be there to hold them the accountable when they do fail. I see technology hopefully filling the gap in terms of access—giving people more access to capital, information, etc., so they can make better decisions and better themselves. So, for example, GoFundMe at this point can be seen as the healthcare system when the traditional one fails. So having stuff like that or Patreon that ensure the people screwed over by the system are getting their needs met. But then also building something that sends a push notification when a healthcare bill that will directly affect your life is going to go through congress or something that can make economic/scientific jargon in papers or bills easier to present to a low-income family. So giving people access to information both outside and inside the government.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Oh, that's super interesting. So not just civic tech, even, but websites like GoFundMe and Patreon.</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>Yeah! So anything that's just finding holes (places where the government should be providing) and then for a short term goal, filling those. Ideally the government would be doing these things, but it's not the case right now, and the tech industry moves faster than the government.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>You talk specifically about Nigeria, since that's where you're from—do companies like GoFundMe and Patreon have a role to play there, or do you see it as more of a job for local ones?</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>Yes, I've seen a lot of Nigerians use GoFundMe for their school fees, hospital bills, etc., and a percentage also rely on outside sources for income (for example, a lot of developers freelance and do work for clients abroad). So yes, they do have roles to play there. But more so in African countries, a significant percentage of the population is bankless and don't have mobile phones and wifi, so a solution like that wouldn't work for them. But I also don't want to be like just give everyone an iPhone and economic growth will happen. It's been hard for me to think about what would be useful for these people cause I've never really been in that position.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Are you concerned about what happens when private companies that are presumably profit-driven take on tasks that have traditionally been the government's responsibility? Or do the benefits maybe outweigh these kinds of concerns?</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>I do think the benefits outweigh the costs, especially in cases where the government is grossly incompetent. But yes, I am concerned. Even with for-profit companies that aren’t necessarily taking on government functions but where governmental issues like freedom of speech come into play, we’ve seen how that can go sour. So it’s even more dangerous for companies doing the “government’s work.” A lot of politicians in Nigeria and even in the US are largely self-interested, but at least to some degree they have a facade to keep.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>People bring their biases to whatever they create, and it seems like the rules about who gets to say or do what are so fickle in private companies.

That’s changing because we’re more likely to call them out for their bad behavior. Private companies try to work efficiently because, if they don’t, they lose money and die but there hasn’t been much consequence for them being sneaky and breaking laws. For a lot of companies things like equality and safety are an afterthought. So that does scare me. Like George Zimmerman successfully raised money on Kickstarter, but Chanel Lewis’ campaigns were shut down. People bring their biases to whatever they create, and it seems like the rules about who gets to say or do what are so fickle in private companies. They can change their rules as they see fit. In that the speed at which they grow and make decisions becomes a problem.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. It feels like a system that requires a lot of trust. Do you see any ways that private companies can be held more accountable, maybe?</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>I like the culture of dragging people.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Same.</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>Well, not dragging—maybe more exposing. I think diversity and inclusion plays a role. Having a diverse set of experiences, not just that are in the room but are able to speak up. We need whistleblowers. A huge part of that is fighting for employees' rights to criticize without risking their livelihood. Like the stuff with Uber and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/technology/personal-data-firm-slice-unroll-me-backlash-uber.html\">Unroll.me</a>. It didn't start when that article was written. It's been going on, but I guess no one could say anything or were scared, too? Meanwhile, the Fyre Festival is a complete mess, and we are able to get every detail because an employee didn't have to sign an NDA. Aside from that, we've seen that the idea of voting with your dollar works at least sometimes.

Doree Shafrir's new book?</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>Yes!</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Well, so I'm in the middle of it, and one comment that struck me was when Mack is pitching to VCs, and he talks about how his company could have infinite scale. That kind of mentality seems pretty prevalent in the Valley—that the best possible scenario is your company scaling to every single person in the world. but in light of everything we're discussing, that's potentially pretty scary? Do you think there are alternatives to how people can approach building/growing companies?</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>Yeah, I don't know much about business, but I feel like the obvious approach is stop and think and also listen to people? Another thing the book touches on is this idea that the founder believes he's changing the world and creating something that is so useful and necessary and he ignores those who think otherwise and does whatever it takes to get that startup growing. There's an ego problem there that needs to be addressed. Why is your idea so important that you need to do whatever it takes and everyone who raises any form of criticism is just against your progress?</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>There’s an ego problem there that needs to be addressed.

A lot of companies take their business model, migrate to a country in Africa and then fail and say Africa is not ready for development. They don't bother to think that their business model or idea isn't for everyone won't work in that form everywhere because they don't listen to people who know better than they do. They just assume. It seems like a reasonable and maybe obvious thing to do would be to stop and ask.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, you would think. Okay, so switching topics now—you're really interested in art and design and how technology intersects with that. What are some of the ways you're thinking about that? Or maybe some interesting projects other people are doing lately that you find interesting?</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>I like the idea of art shedding light on things we already have an idea about. When people talk a lot about black wealth, they say stuff like, \"You shouldn't buy Jordans or weaves,\" or, you know, poor people shouldn't have iPhones. So I started thinking of a game where you would try to close the wealth gap by reducing the number of Jordans in your closet and the conclusion would be something like going back ten generations you would have had to have bought ten Jordans every day for the rest of your life to close the gap or something. Or like juxtaposing politicians' tweets about MLK or a mass shooting with their votes on issues like affirmative action and gun control.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>So art that makes a statement, socially or politically?</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>Yeah, mostly. That it's not telling you what to do necessarily or making a statement explicitly but the project presents a question that upon answering you start to think differently. This is a simple example but the only one I can think of right now—<a href=\"http://www.andrewherzog.com/outside.html\">OutsideInside</a>. It shows you what your surroundings look like, and then you ask yourself, \"Why am I not outside?\"</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, that's really cool. Does technology enable or maybe accelerate that kind of creativity in a fundamentally different way? Or is it one tool of many?</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>Yeah! If the purpose is consumption and for the spectator to have some kind of connection to your art piece, the chances of that happening is greater if you actually know the spectator or can make a reasonable assumption about them. That kind of art—that relies on information about the spectator is more powerful. We can ask more of viewers and users when using technology. Like, the OutsideInside project can get your location, and data viz projects can get user data from Twitter or wherever. The likelihood of someone coming across your project and going, \"I see myself in this,\" is greater.</p><p><a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/228317/an-artwork-forces-us-to-face-mexicos-disappeared-students/\">Here's</a> another example. Basically, he gets biometric data from the user and finds a resemblance in one of the missing children from Mexico.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Are you optimistic about the future of this kind of art? I've been thinking a lot about the question of creation versus consumption, and it feels like very much an open question whether people will be able to create deep, thoughtful work—like good, long-term investigative reporting or this kind of thought-provoking art—in a way that's sustainable for the creators.</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>Our support for artists is limited.

But then I'm not super optimistic about anything, really. I know people are willing to give to an idea they believe in, but not necessarily to individuals. I know personally when I think of giving to art, it's more so \"I want this cool thing to be created\" or \"I want to own this\" rather than \"I want this artist to live a good, stable life.\" Our support for artists is limited. People still believe \"good work\" should be free—i.e., activism, art, tweetstorms. The people able to make a living off making great art are the exception. A whole lot more of consumption is happening because of the Internet, but I don't think artists are receiving what they deserve yet. I think we have issues with supporting someone's choice to produce out of the structures that have been established.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, exactly. Do you feel like that's changing with things like Patreon? Or not in any meaningful way?</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>I feel like Patreon is changing things, but, I don't know, I feel like it's still very much I'm paying to consume and not to support? Which might not be a bad thing. But it would be nice if sustaining themselves didn't come at a price of having to create for a reason other than that's what they like to do. It's like, give your Patreon fans special rewards! Still feels like their work is influenced/corrupted in some way. Basically, I'm just ready for a basic income.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Oh, wow, okay. Want to elaborate on that?</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>Like, a lot of artists create because it's natural to them. They like doing it. When people pay to \"allow\" them to do what they love, it's corrupted in a way. It becomes harder to create without inhibition or to create without thinking of your fans or audience. And it seems the only way to achieve complete freedom to create is to remove dependence on others, which is where the basic income would come to play. Remove inhibition so people can create as they please.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>A lot of artists create because it’s natural to them.

Basic income is always an interesting topic when it comes to tech because I feel like, in a lot of ways, it absolves tech of the fault that comes with displacing jobs. Not that that applies in the case of artists so much.</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>Yeah, I mean, the government and VCs seem to be invested in putting money in places that do less to solve the needs of people so they might be able to provide for themselves. We'd be fine with their plans to make another planet habitable for humans if maybe we had access to food, water and a place to live from a basic income. It's just ridiculous that we are focusing so much on certain types of innovation when some people don't yet have clean water.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Is there a good way to think about how to balance the two?</p><p><strong>OMAYELI</strong></p><p>I don't know, really. I think maybe I'd be satisfied for now with more money going to social good efforts than innovation—and I mean the self driving cars kind of innovation.&nbsp;But if the private companies were periodically thinking of ways within their existing business models to help out, that'd be good also. So thinking, what's a natural extension of our product that can be used to benefit people? Like Airbnb and the homeless. They <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/welcome/refugees\">stepped up</a> with the refugee crisis, but many asked why they haven't done anything for homelessness.</p>\n</div>"

We started there, talking about code literacy in the general public, and then moved to topics like the incentive structures and measures for success for tech companies today, the early days of the web, and the disappearance of maker culture.</h3>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>So one thing that I read that you wrote a couple years ago, which is how I found you on the internet in the first place, was your \"What Is Code?\" piece for Bloomberg. And I thought that was really good—I was wondering what you think about to what extent should everyone understand technology, and are there consequences if the general public doesn't understand? Or is it maybe a responsibility of tech companies to make it more transparent and easy?</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>So, first of all, I'll tell you just an anecdote, which is that my dad was an English professor, and he was very motivated by technology, just found it really interesting. And so, growing up, he found both worlds—he did creative writing and he had plays produced but also found the world of just writing little programs really interesting—and so the things that I remember growing up would be going over and playing with computers with him when I was six or seven and then going and seeing his creative writing students line outside the door as he worked on the student magazine with them.<br /><br />And so I just saw the world as just fitting together really well, and there was a point he made a one point—I might have been thirteen—\"You know, a program's a little bit like a poem, and you're trying to express as much as possible in as short an amount of space as possible.\" So there's always been this very blurry line between those two worlds for me that I didn't perceive growing up and that I had to learn existed.<br /><br />So when we talk about people learning... programming is a very, very discrete activity that has a tremendous amount of socioeconomic things hanging off of it right now. But thinking robustly about technology should not be divorced from a regular, canonical education, in my opinion. I'll give you an example.<br /><br />Right now, books on paper are having an economic resurgence. Sales are up and they're increasing over e-books. And people see this as some great, dynamic thing, but if you look at it—I feel like if you just Occam's razor the hell out of it—books are great. They work really well for a vast majority of high-density, especially visual, content. Typography on paper is still much better than typography on the screen. They definitely suck in terms of—like, I love having a hundred books on my Kindle, especially on the train. They tend to be a little more garbage-y.<br /><br />But then I just bought an academic book by a sociologist named Tressie Cottom, and every now and then, you buy a Kindle book, and they've laid it out like a book because the publisher won't compromise, and it's impossible to read. The text is bigger than the screen, and it doesn't reflow according to the Kindle's algorithms. And I'd much rather have just bought it on paper—I should have just gotten it on paper. And now it sucks because I can't just get a paper copy.<br /><br />So what I'm doing is a roundabout way of saying—the emphasis on technology as the \"other\" is purely, to me, about money. And an enormous space has been created where people can make a ton of money, and they're very protective of that space. We've mythologized people like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, and they're really good, efficient capitalists, and they've built their empire on top of code. That's what they've done. They've built it on top of efficiency.<br /><br />But the mental models that got them there have existed for thousands of years. Like, codex books are really good technology. The alphabet is an excellent technology. Digitization has encoded all that, and I love it—it's my career—but I feel that because there's this sort of essential Luddite nature, especially in the humanistic disciplines, where technology is seen as something outside. You've gone and worked at an email company because you're probably a little obsessed with human communication patterns, right? You told me you were frustrated with email clients.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>We’ve mythologized people like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, and they’re really good, efficient capitalists, and they’ve built their empire on top of code. That’s what they’ve done. They’ve built it on top of efficiency. But the mental models that got them there have existed for thousands of years.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Yeah.</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>You had some kind of mismatch in your brain between what you needed in communication and what you were getting. And then to the point that you went and worked at an email company. You could have worked somewhere else. And so you had a fundamentally human communication anthropological communication issue that you were trying to resolve, and it was internal. It was some gap that wasn't filled to the point that you're going to go make those tools.<br /><br />The thing that all the tech has done is it's made it—you had this problem that you wanted to solve, and, fifty years ago, you would have just had to go, \"Well, I'm going to make a list in a notebook this way,\" or, \"I'll format my letters a little differently with my typewriter.\" But you now live in this world where you can go and be like, \"I'm going to create some new abstractions on top of human communication, and I'm going to work with people who also share my vision about those abstractions. And I'm going to code those, and then I'm going to seek to effect changes in human behavior because of the work I do.\"<br /><br />So that's the one thing that I think is really, really different. That it didn't used to be possible unless you just could gain a lot of power—government power or whatever—where you could make people change their behavior to that level, that quickly, using something like a piece of software to download. So understanding and talking about those power dynamics, seeing them as an extension of the last ten thousand years of history and freaking out less about the computer being this other entity or the internet being this other entity—just seeing it as an expression of humans being humans.<br /><br />That is something that should be a conversation, all the way through school. In the same way that I think that advertising should be—middle schoolers should learn. They're completely attacked by it on all sides. They should learn how to make ads. They should advertise the crap out of everything. You want to give people control over the forms.<br /><br />So that's the very, very longwinded way to answer your question, which is that—should everyone learn to code? Everyone should seek to empower themselves to understand more about the world that they're in. Coding is not communicated as a path to that. It's communicated as a way to riches or a socioeconomic ladder. There's a way to look at it where you can be like, \"This is a way to explore and understand the world.\" You could never have parsed all the census data yourself—but you can now. You can download it and mess with it. If you want your own portrait of America based on census data, you can hit an FTP server, download it, and run a Python script. You'd probably have something in an hour. That's a very different attitude toward the census than you could have had thirty, forty, years ago.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. It's interesting because what you were talking about, in terms of coding being sort of a natural expression of the way people think—it's weird because I felt like that? I was very intimidated by it initially, and then when I was learning it, I was like, \"Wow, this all makes so much sense.\"</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>I think we've created a priestly class, right? But most of it—the vast majority—if you can get algebra, you can code. And we've created this sense of the supergenius programmer. And there are supergenius parts that are really hard—they're just hard, and you can learn them over years, and maybe you're one of the small cluster of people who are really good at it. I'm not. I had to learn it painfully, and I was never good as a kid, but I decided I wanted to get some control over the computer. And it took me years. There's always stuff you can do along the way, too. You don't just have to be a programmer—you can do some HTML pages. It's not immediate, instant, six-figure salary, but there are things you can do.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>So you've talked a little bit about the idea of the 10x engineer. And so I wonder, why do you think these kinds of myths—or I don't know what you would call them, ideas—exist in tech and not other places? Is it the same sort of othering?</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>Well, it is—they do and they don't, right? I think there's absolutely the myth of the 10x lawyer. In philosophy, there's the myth of the 10x philosopher. Not just myths—it's actually encoded. Like [Saul] Kripke, right? I can't understand a single thing he's ever written down, but he's clearly seen as a 10x philosopher, except we just give him a Guggenheim fellowship and don't call it 10x. It's like anything—we like to mythologize certain aspects of human behavior, and some people are just god-awful smart and completely obsessed.<br /><br />I have a personal theory of human talent, which is that talent is basically what people are annoyed by. And if you are someone who has an enormous amount of time and you are a person with a certain amount of capacity—you are a very smart person and you have a lot of focus and you are allowed to obsess over a problem—you will shoot past everybody else. And that means that you probably don't have kids at home, you're probably fairly young, and you have time and space to [obsess].<br /><br />There are incredibly gifted, talented people in this field, like there are in any field. And they're not going to come work at your startup. They're going to go work on weird issues in cryptography. The real random supergeniuses of the world—they go find their place. People are looking for them. Harvard Math is looking for them, MIT is trying to absorb them. And there are places and structures for them to go think ridiculously abstract thoughts. And, you know, one of the smartest people I've met in the last year—I've probably sat down with four or five hundred people overall since starting this company—was a woman named Cathy O'Neil, who did a book called <em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em>.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Oh, yeah.</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>And she is the prototype—Harvard math PhD, went and worked at hedge funds—just the archetypal math genius type. And she had started to pick apart algorithmic reasoning and thinking in a sort of social critic point of view. And I mean, you talk to her for ten minutes, and you're like, \"Whew, wow, that is a really smart person.\" And so she's definitely ten times further along than most people thinking about algorithmic social issues. I think it's just like anything—you can't totally discount that some people are going to get you further. There's a ton of reasons why. But the people who have the most time and the resources to do exactly what they want and who are obsessed with and frustrated by the problem tend to make the most progress.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. Cool. So another thing, then. You mentioned when you started using computers too much—or a normal amount—it started permeating into your subconscious life. And I identified with that a lot because I've probably had dreams about programming. Do you think that's just anything you do too much? Or do you think that's something sort of specific to computers?</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>I think it's like anything you do too much, except that the things that you do on the computer tend to be very constrained. So I remember once I was playing Tetris all the time, and I had Tetris dreams. But if you think about it, it's just like your brain is in that little falling blocks space, and so you spend six, seven, hours there a week, and suddenly you're having a Tetris dream. I think that happens with people who are heavy-duty gamers, too—they're in the space of the game.<br /><br />Your brain doesn't know where it is half the time. We assume we're these very present, conscious entities, but if you're watching TV, where are you? You're in your room, but you could also be in the fictional space that you're watching. I don't think it's unusual to have TV dreams.<br /><br />You know, I haven't had one of those in a long time. I remember having really clear Photoshop dreams because I was using lots of Photoshop. But these are cultural spaces that have been created. You've got your toolbar, and you have your set of things that you do—you blur, you draw a rectangle, you cut and paste. And as I learned more and more about the technology underneath—I now have a pretty good mental model of how the computer is operating—it's much less likely that I have that sensation because I'm just maybe a little more unimpressed. I'm way more aware of the technology I'm using being a technology created by people than I used to be. It doesn't take over my brain in quite the way that it used to.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>I remember once I was playing Tetris all the time, and I had Tetris dreams.

I was using Photoshop, I was blurring things. A face showed up in my dream, and then I would cut and paste parts from the dream.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Wow, weird.</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>This is years ago. Yeah. At that point, I was doing lots of design work, and I was spending six, eight, twelve hours a day in Photoshop.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. Okay, so one other thing you talked about was differentiating between computers being good at math and computers seeming like they're good at math. Do you connect that with the idea of AI and sort of whether machines can have the more anthropomorphic qualities that we want to attribute to them?</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>I mean, I think humans attribute anthropomorphic qualities to everything, right? You put eyes on a cardboard box, and people will be like, \"Hey, what's happening there?\" I don't know. Right now, everybody's very excited about machine learning, and computers are able to \"intuit\" things using neural networks. When I'm looking at that, what I'm seeing is the computer is able to write its own programs, that way, and that—but it's kind of a black box and it kind of isn't. I think we'll create better tools to help us understand the kind of patterns that are found by the neural networks.<br /><br />The history of AI has always been, \"This amazing thing is going to happen to make the computer more like a person,\" and then by the time it actually happens, it's incredibly well understood as a mechanical process. So computer vision is a great example. Self-driving cars, for the most part, we're starting to culturally understand as a LIDAR and radar and laser assembly that spins around really fast on top of a car and quickly analyzes the space around, looking for 3D objects that could pose a threat. That doesn't sound like a baby recognizing a red ball.<br /><br />As these things come into our world and we start to deal with them as technologies, the anthropomorphization part gets separated out. You think it's going to be like, \"Oh, now that computers can see, we're going to have this kind of relationship with them,\" but the reality is that we just take it for granted, and it gets cheaper, and we're like, \"Yeah, okay, that's cool.\" You know. The car can drive itself now. That'll be fifteen, twenty, years from now—\"Oh, the car can drive itself. Of course it can.\" And people talk about how awesome it is to have a car that you drive as opposed to letting the robot drive the car, in the same way that they talk about vinyl albums.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, sure.</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>Right? We get into the old technologies because they're very evocative when they're compared with the new stuff.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. Do you think this gap between the technology, the AI, that we have, becoming no longer AI, it's just a tool, is partly a byproduct of just not understanding the human brain and how it works?</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>I think that's it. We truly are still figuring out the brain, and then—yeah, things seem magical and new, and they get marketed to us. But the great electronic brain has been a myth since the 50s. My basic sense of reality is that it's physical, and my basic sense of technology is that Turing machines can simulate most things, so if you were to tell me that a computer could become an excellent simulator of human consciousness, I would buy it. And I don't know what steps you'd need to take—it's just Moore's Law. I think obviously some sort of processing happens at the neuron level that we don't fully understand and can't capture yet.<br /><br />And if you told me twenty years from now that this consciousness is equivalent to a specific human and it interacted with me and it deserved respect, I'd be like, \"Sure.\" It's like, it would just be another weird consciousness that we need to respect in our world, right? I'm nice to dogs, too. I think people love to obsess with this problem, but it doesn't actually have a lot of bearing on doing better in your immediate [space]—it's great to worry about superintelligence and far less exhausting than dealing with human beings and worrying about the consequences of your own actions. Because it's a wonderful myth of rapture—where everything's like, \"Rather than being nice to everybody today, we should probably figure out how to get ready for the coming AI apocalypse.\" That's way more fun than thinking about the fact that your car is destroying the planet.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>It’s great to worry about superintelligence and far less exhausting than dealing with human beings and worrying about the consequences of your own actions.

Okay, so another thing, unrelated, but—you said at some point that coding favors blurters and people who make fast decisions. And some of the people I've been talking to—a lot of the recurring themes have been that there's so little oversight and decisions get made so quickly by so few people, in terms of technology that gets built and then has an impact on potentially billions of people. But it seems like there's a tension between wanting to slow down that process and—</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>Well, you're not talking about coding, then, really—the engineering culture favors blurters. The better code tends to be written by careful, meditative people. The stuff that powers rockets is not written lazily. NASA's coding guidelines are very clear. If everyone followed them, we'd all be working at about one-tenth the speed. What you're looking at is this moment that we're in, right, where we have networks and we have new ideas permeating through the networks, and the ability to scale and communicate something or get people to use a new piece of software.<br /><br />So I'll give you an example. The web was a document delivery platform. Now it's a software delivery platform. People like to send software through the internet—mostly in the form of executable JavaScript. The cost roughly approaches free, and the work to do it, you know, could be three months, and you could have a huge hit product on your hands, and it could be seen by anywhere between a million and a couple billion people, depending on the kind of experience it is or something. To get to the billion is usually—you've become a much larger company, but nonetheless, it's vast amounts of human beings compared to the amount you used to be able to reach.<br /><br />Instagram is a good example. A relatively small number of human beings—thirteen, I think—were able to make something that had tens of millions of users very quickly, were bought by Facebook for a billion dollars, now have something like two or three hundred million users? And they were able to build it using the Django open-source framework using Python and commodity cloud servers. So the toolkit is there for people to be able to move very quickly.<br /><br />I mean, the thing with Instagram was that it was a fun way to share photos. No one was looking for a cultural point of view, especially because early days it wasn't all Kim Kardashian and beautiful Italian villas. It was way more low-key and happening and people actually were communicating. People who succeeded on the platform were still fairly indie and were showing their lives. And so it just explodes—we've created a roadway where it's very easy for stuff to fan out to millions of people, increasingly because of the economic power of the giant networks of Google, Facebook, Apple, etc. By the time anything hits a certain scale, they try to buy it.<br /><br />WhatsApp is a great example. I don't know if this was ever reported, but I had a friend of mine who was like, \"Oh, yeah, clearly what happened was that Google kept bidding up WhatsApp because they wanted to make Facebook pay $19 billion. Facebook probably could have bought it for $6 billion, but because of the bidding war and the pressure and their sense of WhatsApp taking away their potential share of a market, they spent $19 billion.\" And so the independent entity that was growing, known as WhatsApp, doesn't exist anymore, it's just become a part of Facebook.<br /><br />And I think we're in this very weird zone where these enormous new entities are keeping very careful watch over the marketplace because they feel threatened by newcomers. Newcomers have the ability to achieve quick scale, but—Snapchat's a good example. It's expanding, expanding, expanding, to the point that Facebook has said, \"Okay, we will now basically clone your product.\" No, right? And that's just straight-up capitalism. Like, \"Okay, we see the scale you've reached, and you won't sell to us. Therefore, Instagram will now start to absorb more and more of your functionality, and we'll see what consumers think.\"<br /><br />And so the culture of blurters, right, if you think about building an Instagram, that's who you want. You want someone who's like, \"I did it! I stayed up all last night and I got the new photo-sharing feature. It's all built.\" And you're like, \"Whoa, we didn't even talk about this!\" And they're like, \"Yeah, but check it out!\" And you're like, \"Shit, okay, let's release it. Let's see what happens.\" And you've got GitHub, and you put it up, and it autodeploys to all these servers, and everybody goes, \"Good job!\"<br /><br />Only later do you realize that you have rebooted visual culture along the lines of little rectangular images with filters. And that it is favoring certain ways of looking at women and certain ways of looking at conspicuous consumption that have negative social impact. But that was one programmer who stayed up late. And three, four, years later, we're having conferences about the effects.<br /><br />But the reality, too, is that if that had been a motivated, do-gooder, super positive leftie, you know, intersectional theorist programmer, and they had stayed up late because they love this community growing, it might have had the exact same effect. So it's really easy to attribute ideology to those patterns, and it's just that once things scale and lots and lots of human beings get involved, the fundamental crappy parts of human culture sort of start to permeate back through. Twitter's a great example. You couldn't have a more annoying bunch of do-gooders trying to create Twitter, and then the platform they create ends up having enormous issues, to the point that it's one of the mode of engines of electing a terrible, racist president of the United States. That's a real thing Twitter did.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Do you think there are ways to design software in a way that discourages that, I guess? There was one piece that I think somebody who works here wrote, about building kind social networks.</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>Sure. Oh, Kevin Barrett, yeah.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. And is that something that people can sort of preemptively, strategically build?</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>Yes, but it is often in direct opposition to tremendous growth in the marketplace. Which is two things, right? Because the demand isn't there in the same way that it is for the open broader networks. And the advertisers aren't as excited, so on. So you're deciding to hobble your growth by doing that. If you have a source of revenue or you have an active community that's willing to chip in, then you're fine. Then you can keep that growing for as long as you want. If you're trying to compete or grow in the larger systems, that just tends not to work.<br /><br />We're in a pickle. We're in a weird place. And the standards are now impossibly high. Everyone has decided that success now looks like a billion users and billions of dollars and private pools at every one of your properties. The person who makes $10 million is just garbage. You know, they didn't succeed, right? But if you are a person who has grown up in this culture and read Hacker News and really believes in it—I come from the world of the humanities, where just even making a salary is incredibly suspicious. You probably shouldn't do it, right? I mean, I'm sure, you're leaving a philosophy program to go back to Silicon Valley. There are some people who are like, \"Hmmm, Jackie. I guess you weren't serious. Guess you didn't really want the golden dream of making $24,000 a year as an adjunct while somebody yells at you every day.\" Certain of your classmates are on that path.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>We’re in a weird place.

And most people don't. Most startups don't succeed. So there's just all this kind of bad mythmaking, and the way that the network works really contributes to the negative patterns of human interaction that you see. At the same time, stuff like email still works really well. I'm not just saying that because you work at Nylas. Email is the great social network. It monetizes terribly—it just does, and it's expensive because of spam, and it doesn't have the right kind of protections built in—but in terms of transferring data and messages between human beings, it's just freaking unbeatable.<br /><br />But nobody owns it. It pairs really poorly with advertising. You get services like Gmail, which it kind of works with advertising, and you get the various $25 per user per year things, and you get stuff like Nylas. It's all really good, but you're carving out a piece of a global market rather than creating your own marketplace. And the VCs secretly want everyone to come to them and say, \"Once we build this, we will have created a market.\"</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>So something you were talking about a little bit earlier was about how Facebook, for instance—or just all of the large companies—are becoming these sprawling entities. And one of your dumb questions for 2016 was about quantifying the global power outside of market cap.</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>I mean, Facebook is bigger than Spain, right? It's so big. When you talk to people from Facebook, they're very aware of this, but ultimately they see themselves as good actors who are trying to increase communication between people. And they've had insane scale thrust upon them and are doing the best they can. There's no real governance, right? There's no clear law about these new entities. As it gets imposed, they fight it viciously. Good example is Google versus—there's a concept in European law of the right to be forgotten. Do you know about this?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Like, people can petition to be not listed in search results?</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>Not erased. Let's say there was coverage of a lawsuit you were involved in ten years ago in a newspaper. You can petition—I guess roughly after a certain amount of time—you can petition to have the results for your name for those articles removed from Google search index. You're not erasing the historical record, you're not necessarily removing it from the newspaper search engine, but the first thing that someone types when they type in their name, if it was results from the article, will no longer show up.<br /><br />To my mind, that is a sensible compromise. I think that you will not get a job if the first thing that shows up in your Google search results is the lawsuit you were involved in fifteen years ago, the stupid thing you said, whatever. People have to be allowed some ability to move on from their past. I tend to think of it as a good thing.<br /><br />I had a direct experience of it when I was an editor at Harper's Magazine because I put the whole archive up, back to 1850, and suddenly people who had had something written about them in the mid 90s—this article would show up, that was about them and something paints them in a negative light. And as long as they didn't threaten a lawsuit, at which point I would have to take it to general counsel or I would have to take it to the general manager who would then call counsel because of our liability, I would basically put it into `robots.txt`. Ignore this page, Google, don't search it.<br /><br />So the historical record of Harper's was inviolable. That was important, and it was digital, and you could come and gain access to it. But I didn't feel any need that something that no one could search before—some guy was trying to get a job as a paralegal, and he felt I was blowing up his chances. I was like, \"Yeah, of course. Let's just get that out of there, and hopefully in a week or two it'll be out of the archive.\" And I just felt that that was fair. You shouldn't have to have some paragraph mention of you follow you around. Now, someone who kills someone or does something really bad—that's a different story. But just a lot of the news is about bad divorces between normal people who are not public figures, and it's like, \"Don't ruin their lives.\"<br /><br />So that's an example of litigation attempting to engage with the power of these platforms and ultimately succeeding. That right doesn't exist in the United States, but it does exist in Europe. But we do not have Congress that understands this world. We have a tremendous amount of lobbying effort now that is trying to keep stuff from changing. So I think that Facebook is going to attempt to remake the world in its own image because it's a giant force and that is in its best interest. Google, actually, in some ways, has. We just assume that search will work, and it functions as a free commodity, and it has an enormous amount of cultural power.<br /><br />We spent a hundred years trying to break up the Bell System and then finally did in the 80s, so maybe that conversation ends up happening, but the Bell System was like if Google and Facebook were one company. I think right now we're just going to be in the middle of it for twenty or thirty years. The giants are going to play, and they're going to fight, and there'll be new forces, and change will come when something exists that they can't acquire. But for right now we're just going to live in the world of search and social. Who knows? Things blow up in this industry every five or ten years. Facebook has an ungodly amount of power. And then Apple does, too. Actually, Microsoft still does—so these giants really are locked in. And they're thinking ten, twenty, years out at this point.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>That's a little bit—</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>It is! I don't know whether I feel bad for people coming up—I had a sense of incredible social opportunity from the early days of the web, and anybody could connect to anybody, and it was global, which at that point felt insane. The fact that people from London or China or wherever were looking at web pages I made. It blew my mind. Because in my head, it was the equivalent of photocopying and mailing them out. That had been the low-cost distribution channel before, and so suddenly you had—the world was merging, and people were communicating in ways they hadn't before, and nobody was watching because it didn't have much social power. And so it was wonderful to ride that wave and see how that worked.<br /><br />That is not that this is anymore. This is now an entrenched part of culture with unbelievable power, related to political power, media power, economic power. And so the core is that anyone can publish a web page or anyone can send an email. That's still real. But the cultural immune system around it is now far more devolved. And so I think part of me is bummed that people who are coming up in this world, people in your cohort, don't get to participate in that sense of play, but you're also not going to get it snatched away from you by $400 billion corporations who will consistently tell you that their platform is the only way to communicate. I don't know. I mean, it's nice to write something on Medium and know that I'll get a couple thousand people to read it, you know. I spent years writing things that ten people would read. And maybe I'm just nostalgic for when I was younger. But there is—that sense of exploration isn't quite the same.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>The world was merging [in the early days of the web], and people were communicating in ways they hadn’t before, and nobody was watching because it didn’t have much social power.

What's something you're thinking about lately or wondering related to—</p><p><strong>PAUL</strong></p><p>Sure, all this? The work I'm doing and the things I'm thinking, when I'm not running the business—there is a real bifurcation between consuming and making. And the cool thing about the early days of the internet, up through Geocities and all that stuff, were that you would make something and you would put it up and you would consume other people's content. And the endgame of that, I think, was Twitter, which was just you could really blurt something out, and it'll be distributed to the people in your following list and so on.<br /><br />But I feel that the opportunity of the web and of the internet in general, to me, was that it was a vast global notebook filled with other people's ideas, and it should be possible to do something with those ideas. They're abstract objects, they're pages, they're paragraphs, and so on. That was always the promise, which was that you could extract a paragraph and link it to another paragraph. That was the original hypertext vision—the whole document space was a kind of giant application, and you could build on top of it.<br /><br />So if I think about anything, I think about, \"Is there a way for me as a writer to use the web as a giant notebook? Are there ways for me to look at web pages and see them and understand them in different ways from just reading the text? What are the inherent latent APIs that are all around me that I've stopped looking at because I've been given these experiences, like going to the NYTimes.com or Twitter?\"<br /><br />It's so easy to consume. It didn't used to be that easy—you had to go looking for things. Part of that is wonderful. Part of that is you just can bathe in [content]—I can goof around on Twitter for an hour and know everything that's going on in the world, be in touch with a lot of friends, and make a bunch of stupid jokes, and then just go back to my life. So part of that is wonderful.<br /><br />But the other part of that is that—time on Twitter feels like time goofing off or making a point or ensuring that your tribal affiliations are solid. But it doesn't feel like time making. The tweets don't add up to a corpus. I miss that. If you look back a month ago or two months ago, my tweets would be roughly the same as the tweets I'm posting now. There wouldn't be this tremendous sense of growth. When I was writing every day or blogging or doing weird code stuff, I could point back to months before when I had just not known something and now I knew something new and I created something new. And I don't feel that the platforms that we have today encourage people to create at that level. They don't make us into new people.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>I don’t feel that the platforms that we have today encourage people to create at that level. They don’t make us into new people.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>One thing about getting older is that I used to have a fantasy that that was what people wanted. It's not. Most people don't want that. The vast majority want to catch up on their friends, share a recipe, live their lives, watch TV. And they don't have the time and mental energy to get big new experiences all the time. They're not seeking it. But there's a portion who do, and I think that they're underserved. More people could be making more stuff, but the platforms don't encourage it.<br /><br />So what I'm thinking, what I'm working on, what I'm trying to solve, what are some patterns whereby we can get people back into making things? But also I think it needs to be semi-non-commercial. I think that companies and startups that try to do that because the demand—counting on humans to make stuff for you is very risky, and trying to build a business on that is very risky. So for me, anything I come up with along these lines probably will be something I can use to write with, and that will validate that—at least then I'll be using my own tool. We'll see what I come up with.</p>\n</div>"

Most people think that the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful advance of human society—we could support much larger populations, specialization of work, not everyone had to be out hunting and gathering all the time. But the other way to look at it is that we were then tethered to the land. We were stuck with the back-breaking work of tilling the soil, planting, harvesting. And we had less diversity in our diets, which came to be built around a few staple crops, and less healthy exercise from just going out and exploring. In a way, we were domesticated by these plants that we thought we domesticated.</p><p>So there’s the question—are our lifestyles better because of the Agricultural Revolution? I think people would still argue yes, but it's interesting to have that assumption examined.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It's interesting how ideas take hold and then you can't remember a time when you didn't think this way. I was reading about the Cartesian view of the mind and the body and whatever and just this assumption that everything that makes you you is your mind, basically. So all of these people in tech who are like, \"Someday people will be uploaded,\" and whatever, and just assuming that nothing is lost if the pattern of your mind and whatever is copied onto a server somewhere. It's super interesting.</p><p>So—I guess going off what you were saying before, about how technology isn't always a good thing. Do you think there's sort of a framework for determining what it is and what it isn't, maybe? What are the kinds of things you would look at to sort of make that determination?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>That's an interesting question, I haven’t thought about it framework-level. One way to think about it is, what is it giving, and then what is it taking away? And one interesting pattern of a lot of tech services that have come up in the last few years on the consumer side is that they're all free to use, but...</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>There's a hidden cost?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>There’s that saying: “If you're not paying, then you're the product.” You're paying in terms of your attention, and your attention is what's being monetized. You get to use Facebook, Twitter, etc., for free, but they're making money off of you because they're then selling your attention to advertisers.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>I guess that's one thing I'm thinking about. It's very hard to tell—for instance, with Google. Obviously, lots of great services, but it's really hard to tell what exactly is being given on my part when I'm using it. Like, to which companies is my data being sold?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>Yeah. And how much of your data? Because for them to build the best ads modeling and serve you the most relevant ads—they're tracking all of your history. You're giving up a lot of privacy in exchange for better targeted ads.</p><p>Another thought on services where the economics are worth examining, because there are hidden, non-financial costs. Uber and a lot of other on-demand services are right now very heavily VC-subsidized, so as a consumer you get to benefit from really cool, convenient services that aren’t actually economically viable or sustainable on their own. But there are negative externalities and impacts on people and communities.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>[For Google] to build the best ads modeling and serve you the most relevant ads—they’re tracking all of your history. You’re giving up a lot of privacy in exchange for better targeted ads.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>One popular area of on-demand services has been in laundry. Anecdotally, what I’ve heard happened in some places is people who would have used local brick-and-mortar laundromats to do laundry switched to the on-demand services, which were cheaper than they should have been because of investor money subsidies. But those services eventually folded because they weren’t sustainable — only, by that point, they’d already put the local stores out of business. And the people in those neighborhoods could then neither go to their local laundromat nor call the on-demand services anymore. There are costs to engaging with these services.</p><p>Let’s go back to the car services. I worry not just about the loss of jobs that will eventually happen—it's bad that all these people are getting recruited to become Uber and Lyft drivers, when those companies are simultaneously working on autonomous vehicles to put those people out of work—but also broader impacts to the community when investment in privately owned and operated car services results in lack of investment in public transit. Sure, it makes sense that Uber and Lyft were founded in a city like San Francisco where the public transit is so bad and cabs are terrible, but it’s concerning that that they then reduce political pressure from the well-off (those who can afford car services) to fix the public transit.</p><p>Imagine you're a wealthy person in San Francisco and always take Uber everywhere because it's the fastest way to get anwyhere—you would never take MUNI, and the joke is that MUNI is for when walking isn’t slow enough—and then bonds come up to support MUNI or public transit development. You might think, \"I don't want my money to go toward that because I never use it,\" and that’s because you have your own rich-person alternatives. So I'm much more a fan of New York City in that regard, where it’s much more democratic with transit options, where in many cases it’s fastest to use the subway to get to where you want to go. No matter your level of wealth, it still makes sense to use public transit in many cases. And so then you're much more invested, political capital-wise, in making sure public transit is good.</p><p>There’s a reason that the public sector exists. It creates options at price points that are actually accessible to the general population. Sometimes when I'm using these car service apps, I feel guilty, like I should be supporting public transit instead, giving more ridership to public transit. I don't want to be fueling something that ultimately may be harmful to a wider swath of society.</p><p>It's also a little bit funny in a sad way to see a lot of these car service companies rediscover the idea of public transit. It's like, \"Oh, we're going to have this service where there are predefined routes and people can get on and get off!\" Okay, great! You rediscovered bus routes.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>And these ridesharing services are subsidized with VC money.</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>Oh, they totally are! They're losing money on every ride.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Like, Uber rides—they had that period when rides in San Francisco were $2.</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>$2.25 to match the MUNI price, yeah.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It's just ridiculous.</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>I worry about those interims. In the short term, it's easy to take things that are given to you without critically examining what the cost is—and, you know, actually, this pretty interesting question has come up with Uber and people who are saying, \"Delete Uber, protest Uber.\" Do you want to give support to something that's convenient to you in the short term but really terrible in the long term? Hard to say.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>In the short term, it’s easy to take things that are given to you without critically examining what the cost is.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Cool. So what do you think can maybe change that? What do you think are the conditions that are making these things happen right now? I feel like with these laundry startups, it's kind of —do you think VCs thought they would be economically viable or something, or...?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>They must have believed it at some point, right? They believed that it would become a big business, make them money back. I think there's a few things at play here. One is a very capitalist society where we're just very driven by financial returns. And that causes a lot of people to turn a blind eye to ethical questions. And, again, this comes up a lot with Uber—why do we keep funding people who are terrible human beings? Another example is Parker Conrad, who was the CEO of Zenefits, who basically told people at his company to commit fraud and then helped enable that. And he just raised $7 million to do something else. So there’s a willingness of people who have power and money to keep funding people and businesses that are ethically questionable because they think they'll get financial returns.</p><p>There are also those people who are not evil actors but not aware of the ethical considerations. Some of it's just a lack of humanities education and what we were talking about earlier—this unquestioning belief in technology being the right thing, the best thing—and never being forced to examine those assumptions or to consider what the consequences of their work might be. Or, in some cases, feeling like it's okay to do a day job that might be questionable and earning an ethics offset some other way. There was an interesting <a href=\"https://deardesignstudent.com/ethics-cant-be-a-side-hustle-b9e78c090aee\">Medium article</a> about this concept—you can't have ethics be your side hustle. Have you seen it?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>No, I don't think so.</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>You should look it up! It calls out people who work on things like Uber, or Facebook news feed, in their day jobs and then try to earn “ethics offsets” by volunteering at nonprofits on the weekends. And you can't do that! You need to make the core of what you do something that you can stand behind the values of. But yeah, I think a lot of people just don't really think about the implications of what they're doing. For example, the people who work on Facebook’s news feed were not necessarily thinking in a broader sense about what they were enabling.</p><p>I worked on the news feed for Pinterest—we built machine learning models to optimize engagement, where engagement for Pinterest was defined by repins, likes, clicks. So if we were successful, our models got people to repin and like and click more. I imagine Facebook is doing something very similar, with some engagement metrics they're trying to optimize.</p><p>My guess is that the people working on the news feed were more concerned about the immediate boundaries of their problems, working with their data, mapping it onto machine learning algorithms, tweaking parameters, trying to achieve their optimization targets, than what impact their work might have on the political environment. In their initial conversations about newsfeed they were certainly not debating the propagation of fake news or things that reaffirm people's beliefs whether or not they are true. And then unfortunately that got very large in the election cycle—people starting to be self-segregated into their own little filter bubbles of news or fake news.</p><p>Obviously real issues. But then I think without a stronger grounding in humanities and ethics and thinking about these questions, it's just very easy to pretend they don't exist.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Do you think humanities education, then, is a potential sort of fix?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>I think so. My experience studying engineering in school is unfortunately that I learned nothing about the humanities, and only much later after I started working did I discover topics like feminism and social justice and privilege and theories of oppression and social change and... I wasn't trying to be ignorant, but my attitude in school was, \"I'm trying to get my degree, there is a certain number of classes I need to take, I’m just focused on getting through those.\" Now I&nbsp; wish I had had a more thorough grounding in humanities during the very formative educational period of college.</p><p>I've had really frustrating experiences trying to talk to some tech workers about really basic concepts, things that I feel like they should know as citizens of human society. I don't think they were malicious in any way; they just had never encountered these concepts. With one person that I talked to about social justice and criminal justice, his response was an earnest question: \"Aren't they the same thing?\" I was like, \"Um, no, not exactly, and you should probably know the difference as a citizen, as a human being, kind of part of society.\" He was an Asian-American man, had grown up in America in a pretty privileged coastal area, and so had just never had to encounter the criminal justice system, really, or think about social justice.</p><p>If you're in a position of privilege... the whole definition is that you don't have to worry about it. You have the privilege of ignoring injustice. And so for a lot of these people, it's just really easy to ignore societal, systemic problems or the implications of what they're doing because they've never been confronted with these issues and have no real compunction to. So I think part of producing human beings who will be contributing members of society is making sure that the educations that we're instituting as standard include those parts around humanities and ethics.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>If you’re in a position of privilege... the whole definition is that you don’t have to worry about it.

It seems like, the better technology gets, the fewer people are required to make decisions that impact billions of people, potentially.</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>The tricky thing about regulation, especially around technology, is that it's so hard to know how to regulate correctly, and the whole point of the technology sector is that it's innovating and creating new things, so it's very hard to know what should be regulated. And it's changing so fast—the pace of politics is just not going to be anywhere near that. So I think tech has to be much more self-regulating, than depending on government as regulatory actor. And there's so much that's unknown about information technology. Before Facebook became what it is, no one knew what it would become, so it was hard to say, \"Oh, this is how it should be regulated.\"</p><p>There's new technology with CRISPR where you can edit genes—I don't know what the implications are going to be. I'm sure the government doesn't know, either, and it's really difficult to get lawmakers and people who set policy to be such deep technology experts, who simultaneously have to predict the future and what effects of different policies might be. When things have played out for a little bit longer, there's a role for government to ensure basic standards. But I think it's hard for government to be at the forefront of technology.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>So, kind of a pivot, I guess—what's your personal relationship with technology, just in your life on a daily basis?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>I use it way too much.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Do you feel like that? Do you feel like it's too much and you would like to use it less?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>Yeah, for sure. It’s addictive. I'm constantly on my phone checking Twitter, even though I don't need to be checking Twitter.</p><p>I had a really amusing conversation with someone about Twitter. It was a friend who doesn't use Twitter very much, and someone else was trying to pitch him on why to use it, saying, \"You can get everything in real-time!\" And he said, \"I don't want to get the news in real-time! I don't want to get bombarded with terrible things happening. I just check in once a day to know what terrible things have happened. Why do I need it pushed to me? It's all so negative.\"</p><p>A lot of consumer apps are designed to make you feel this compulsion to check for notifications. You get the little badges, the red dots. You have this many notifications, you want to go check them. You get the quick hit of, \"Oh, someone liked my thing, or responded to me.” But those things don’t make you more satisfied in life. And I've actually found myself appreciating the times where I'm away from my phone and don't care to check it.</p><p>When I go to workout classes, I'm like, \"Yes! My phone will be in my locker, and I’m not going to check it for the next hour because I'm working out.\" Or I'm with friends and I don't want to check my phone because I'm with people, in person, and I want to be fully engaged. I find myself appreciating those times much more.</p><p>But then when I'm not in those situations, I'm still stuck on my phone. It would be so much better if I spent less time on Twitter, less time on Facebook, less time on my phone generally. I’ve actually tried to reduce my time on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, by moving those icons away from my home screen top row into a folder, and then I keep moving the folder around—first page, last page, top row, bottom row—so I'll lose the muscle memory. I actively want to spend less time on technology, but it's just so addictive.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Do you think there's a fix for that? Because it seems like there's kind of this fundamental conflict between what companies are optimizing for and what's actually good for people.</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>Yeah. Especially because the number one thing that companies seem to have figured out how to monetize is attention, all they want is your attention. For the companies that monetize in other ways, like Amazon, which makes money off transactions, they don’t need you glued to their apps. When more companies figure out ways to monetize that are not solely dependent on attention, then it'll be different. This comes up a lot with media, journalism—right now, it's based on attention, and that's why everything is so clickbait-y and reinforcing what you already believe. It's not about quality journalism. But no one has figured out how to monetize quality journalism to the same extent as they've monetized eyeballs. And we operate in a capitalist society, so unless you can tie these other goals to the financial motivators, then it'll be really hard to change behavior.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Do you think you interact differently with different platforms?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>Yeah, for sure.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>It's interesting how—it's hard to tell how conscious it is on the part of Twitter, for instance. Twitter puts me in such a specific sort of mindset, I guess, and mode of interaction with other people on Twitter. What are some of the ways that you experience that? Not necessarily with Twitter, anything. How the design shapes how you behave on it.</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>For me, Twitter and Facebook are really interesting contrasts. Twitter is very real-time; things just keep happening and I feel like I want to keep dipping in to see what's going on. When I tweet, it will get responses, likes, retweets. And things that's happened in the past just kind of flows down.</p><p>On Facebook, which has a much more deliberate news feed algorithm and things don’t move as quickly, I'm not as incentivized to post constantly. Only the “best” stuff gets surfaced, and it's actually kind of frustrating. Things I find much more important never get the news feed attention. Photos get bumped up really fast, certain types of contents do really well on Facebook, and others don't. And it's really annoying to me to feel that difference. On Twitter, it feels like everything is much more... equal. Every tweet I send out gets the same sort of prominence, just in the reverse chronological stream.</p><p>So I post a lot on Twitter and not that much on Facebook, but on Facebook I post the most important things I want to give attention to. Those things might get a few hundred likes. The things I post on Twitter rarely get more than a hundred. But I have a pretty constant stream of stuff on Twitter, like twenty things a day, while I'll reserve just a couple of things I really care to post to Facebook. Like, oh, there's one article that I will share every couple of months onto Facebook.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>How conscious do you think Facebook is about that? Because I would think that they want people to post more, so it's interesting that their design kind of reflects more of the \"big life updates once in a while\" attitude.</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>I think they have enough content from all the people that are using it that they want the content quality to be higher. Each person can only consume a certain amount of content per day. So even if I were to 10x my volume of updates, that doesn't mean you want to see 10x of my stuff. You’d probably still not want to see more than one post a day from me. If my posting ten things meant the best content from me was better and that improved your experience, then they want me to do that. Otherwise, I don't think they need me to be posting all the time, when all of it is just going into the void.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>How do you feel about stories? Or... what is it called, Messenger Day, Facebook Stories?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>Oh my god. I'm not super into it. I think it's just too many things to check. I do kind of buy their argument that it's like news feed. Like, before Facebook did news feed, it was not a format that people consumed information in, but then once news feed came out, it became standard. I buy their argument that stories is just a new format of consuming content. But to me, it's just too much. I don't need any more places to check.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah. So, kind of shifting gears again, this is super random, but I thought about this—what are your thoughts on, for instance, Peter Thiel's interest in young blood, or basically people in tech who kind of want to use tech as a means toward immortality or something close to immortality?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>I find it very strange, kind of weird. I personally don't care very much for immortality, so I don't really get why people are so into it.</p><p>For me, on a more systemic level, I care about improving quality of life for everyone, instead of quantity. So this whole focus on extension of life is not particularly meaningful to me unless we also can figure out quality of life.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>On a more systemic level, I care about improving quality of life for everyone, instead of quantity. So this whole focus on extension of life is not particularly meaningful to me unless we also can figure out quality of life.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>And then there are these questions around the future of work, and how people are going to have incomes to sustain their lifestyles. People will live longer, but there are not necessarily jobs that are good for people at an older age (or even at prime working age). I'm a bit skeptical that we're going to be able to solve these issues.</p><p>It's kind of interesting to look at the population breakdowns in different countries. Some of them have bulges in population at older ages, and those are less sustainable because as those people move towards retirement, there aren’t enough workers to sustain the growth of the economy. And so there are certain governments that are really concerned about this and they're trying to get their citizens to have more kids.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Yeah, yeah, like in Japan.</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>In Singapore, they were actually giving out pamphlets—maybe a joke, I don't know how serious they were, but—pamphlets on how to go on dates.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Oh, wow.</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>They said things like, \"Oh, you should brush your teeth before you go on a date! You know, if they seem interested, you can hold their hand!\" It was kind of hilarious, trying to encourage people to reproduce, basically.</p><p>But yeah, a population bulge with older people but not enough younger people to support that, that’s problematic. China has issues around this because of the one-child policy. Even though they’ve stopped the one-child policy now, there are ramifications still. In a lot of cases, you’ll see a man who has to support his wife, who may not work, and his parents and her parents. Obviously there’s a bunch of gendered stuff going on, too, but all in all, it just doesn’t work very well.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>What are some less sexy problems that you think are important and that need more attention? Because there's definitely radical life extension and there's Elon Musk trying to go Mars, but there are a lot of much more mundane problems that kind of aren't getting as much attention.</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>Yeah. I mean, the sector that I'm working in now is govtech—just trying to improve basic digital services for government institutions that are intended to serve the people but are not very good at it because they have really broken technology.</p><p>I worked in the US Digital Service a couple years ago, in the federal government.</p><p>Just look at government's inability to provide basic services it intends to provide, like with Healthcare.gov, which is what inspired the creation of the US Digital Service. They had this big healthcare reform, they wanted to roll it out, and then it was almost completely derailed by the technological failures.</p><p>The process for applying for immigration—still super paper-based. Federal government spends something like $300 million a year on postage internally for shipping immigration paperwork around. That doesn't seem like it should be necessary, why are we spending so much on shipping paper among processing centers? And it's inefficient.</p><p>There's just so much that could be better about how we serve people. Taxes. The whole process of filing taxes is such a disaster in the US. In countries like the UK and Sweden, sometimes you don't even have to file your taxes—they already know how much you're getting paid and taxes were automatically deducted. I think in Sweden, they can even text you how much you get in returns or not.</p><p>There are so many ways that government could be better serving the people with better technology. There are a lot of reasons why government tech is hard—not in the technical aspects, but in the politics and the bureaucracy you have to navigate through. I think there's a big space of opportunity there.</p><p>A few sectors have been getting more attention, and while I agree the tech there could be better, I don’t think the technology is the primary obstacle to better services; for example, healthcare and education. A decent number of startups and companies in those spaces, but I think fundamentally with healthcare it’s not the technology that’s the problem, it’s the really complicated employer-based insurance system, no single payer; and with education, lots of regulation and bad education policy that is more problematic than the software.</p><p>What else? There are definitely underserved communities, the ones that can't afford to pay as much. Oftentimes that overlaps with the ones disproportionately dependent on governmental services.</p><p>If you’re an entrepreneur, it's more appealing if you can build a product for rich people that will pay you a lot of money for it, right?</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>Are you optimistic about the government adopting new technologies and getting more efficient?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>There are good people working on it now. Efforts like US Digital Service, Code for America, and then generally the socialization of this idea that tech people should do tours of duty in government.</p><p>Before USDS, and CFA, good tech people would typically not want to go anywhere near government. Stay away, don't touch with a ten-foot pole. Very different from other sectors, say law or finance. Clerking for the Supreme Court is very prestigious—and finance, working in the Treasury, like Sheryl Sandberg did—it’s prestigious to be affiliated with those institutions. But for tech people, no way were they going anywhere near the government.</p><p>USDS has done a good job of changing that perception on the federal level. Code for America has been really good, too, more on the municipal level. People are getting into the idea of serving the country. I think some of it is also accelerated by the changing political backdrop and people wanting to get more involved with the functioning of the country and doing good and giving back, so I think there's reason for optimism about more good people wanting to get involved.</p><p>I do think it will be tricky, frustrating, annoying, to make change because so much of government is very risk-averse, bureaucratic, things get ossified. It's hard to make change, but at least there’s more attention on it now.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>So there's USDS and other sort of organizations working kind of within the government, but then there's also sort of this kind of newer wave of tech efforts that are civic-oriented, but totally unrelated to the government. For instance, YC launched their repository of projects, apps, trying to organize immigration data and things like that. What do you think of those efforts?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>I think there's reason to be encouraged by more attention on these efforts, though right now the civic tech space is still trying to figure itself out. It's generally hard for these efforts to get funding, since they’re not going to be big moneymakers. Relying on volunteer crews is also hard.</p><p>A lot of people want to start their own efforts but don't necessarily know the whole space, what's out there. There's not always been a great connect between the people who are the builders on the tech side and the people who know what the problems really are; I think there needs to be more collaboration between the different actors.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>A lot of people want to start their own [civic tech] efforts but don’t necessarily know the whole space, what’s out there.

I'm involved with the <a href=\"https://thearena.run/\">Arena Summit</a>; it's something that a group of us got together to do after the election in November, convening people around the idea of running for office. We've expanded the vision to also be supporting civic entrepreneurship and community-building, so we actually do see a lot of these civic organizations as part of the Arena community: organizations like Flippable, Swing Left, Sister District, Run For Something. A couple of the YC folks, who worked on that repository you mention, were at our last summit recently, too.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>So what is maybe one thing that you're concerned about (maybe it's an area or company) and then one thing that's exciting to you?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>I guess a couple areas of concern that slightly overlap. One's very obvious given all the work I do, around diversity in tech. A lack of diversity has implications for ethics and morality, but also just sheer lack of perspective. And I think this will play out in really interesting ways with some of the new technologies that are being developed, like AR, VR, AI/machine learning.</p><p>So one interesting analysis of current VR tech says that the way they try to simulate the virtual world is primarily geared toward men's perception biology, which is different than women’s, so many women find VR tech now to be dizzying and nausea-inducing.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>That's so interesting.</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>On the AI front, people have a tendency to believe that algorithms are neutral and code is neutral, when, really, algorithms and machine learning models are just codifying the biases of the people who write them or the data that they're fed, and without enough perspective on what that means—and some of this just goes back to our earlier conversation on humanities education and thinking about the implications of what you're doing—without the contemplating all the biases that go in, it's very easy to use algorithms, like machine learning, AI, in a way that can actually be really harmful.</p><p>There's a really interesting book called <em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em> that just came out, where the author talks at length about how data can be used in these very bad ways. We build opaque models that actually just perpetuate bias. For example, there's this tool that prosecutors or police were using to predict recidivism, and it essentially reiterates all the racial and socioeconomic inequality that already exists in the system, though people treat the output of this recidivism predictor as fact.</p><p>It creates a really bad cycle, and people aren’t necessarily thinking about how to create a negative feedback loop. That’s a specific term from systems engineering. The opposite is a positive feedback loop, like the screechy sound you get when a mic picks up a sound and blows it up, which reinforces whatever signal it had originally instead of adjusting based on real world and correcting for bias. We want negative feedback loops that dampen the original bias and bring the system towards an equilibrium.</p><p><strong>JACKIE</strong></p><p>And then maybe a thing that you're excited about?</p><p><strong>TRACY</strong></p><p>Right, what am I excited about? I am generally still very excited about software and making the world more efficient.</p><p>One thing that's kind of cool about more people understanding what software is, is that they also can start to see the ways that software can be beneficial.</p><p>A lot of people ask if coding is new literacy. I don't think everybody has to code professionally or even write code most of the time. I do think it's important for people to get how code works and why it's interesting and relevant and have the mental model for what code is. It’s instructions for computers. And computers are very good at executing those instructions very quickly in the same way every time.</p><p>As more people start to understand what code is and what software is and what new technological systems mean in their lives, they'll know how to interact with them better or even design them. You see this with more people being non-technical founders at tech companies, where they understand enough of what software is to have an idea for how software can solve problems. They don't need to be the ones coding, but if they understand what software is capable of doing, they can recruit people to help implement it. As more people become software-literate, they'll see more opportunities for where software can materially improve a situation.</p><p>I think this is most meaningful for the communities that are underrepresented in tech right now. A lot of what people in tech are doing is just looking at what problems they have in their own lives and solving them. But for the populations not well-represented in tech, that means there aren’t as many people thinking about how to solve their problems. I’m optimistic that this will change.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>“</span>As more people start to understand what code is and what software is and what new technological systems mean in their lives, they’ll know how to interact with them better.<span>”</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>"
